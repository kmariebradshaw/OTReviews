2,4,These are wonderful and really do help the stink! Why can't I get a closet pack with three socks of my choice? I don't need anything for loafers but would love to try the sneakers and get more ballet flats!,2
2,5,Game changer!,2
2,5,I was not expecting to be so impressed by socks! They are so great!  Weightless and a fabulous fit. I am so excited about my Gekks!,2
2,5,"At first I wasn't sure about the small area for my toes. But I've worn them once so far, and they were very comfortable. It was great not having to pull up my little no show socks constantly all day.",2
2,4,"They didn‚Äôt fully prevent the inevitable blisters in my new flats, but they definitely helped. ",2
2,5,Love them!,2
2,5,They make my shoes so much more comfortable,2
2,4,"I love them.  I just wish they came with heel support and and arch support that would fit in a flat along with the sock portion, then it would be perfect.  I hurt my foot and need the extra support. Thanks great product!",2
2,5,Totally saved me from smelly feet whenever I wear flats!,2
2,4,Works great in my shoes.  Bought 3 more pair.,2
2,5,Love these. Going to need another pair!,2
2,5,They are exactly as advertised on your site. Very happy ,2
2,5,"Work great, very comfortable, worth every penny",2
2,5,"I‚Äôve never been this skeptical and gave something a shot, but I did. 
They work, 100%. I‚Äôm shocked and very pleased!",2
2,5,WOW! I will def be buying more in the future. I haven't been able to wear boat shoes for more than 15 minutes without getting a blister or super sweaty feet. These are amazing! Thank you :),2
2,5,I bought these to put in my Tieks. I love them. Comfortable and easy to put in place. ,2
2,4,I have not worn them as of yet due to the fact that I mostly wear sandals during the summer.  I am concerned about the adhesive and it‚Äôs staying power.  Wondering how effective they will be once washed.,2
2,5,"Super comfortable! I highly recommend these to anyone who is getting blisters and experiencing issues with your ""average"" flat.",2
2,4,I really like them! They sometimes just feel like they fall down but they‚Äôre slways still there! So far so good! ,2
2,5,Love the design and easy application. My flats don‚Äôt smell anymore and I can be confident that they will last.,2
2,4,I really like them! They sometimes just feel like they fall down but they‚Äôre slways still there! So far so good! ,2
2,5,A serious game changer!! I no longer have to worry or think about my socks coming off and have to adjust at work. ,2
2,5,They work great!  Exactly what I was looking for.,2
2,5,Love these! Just what I needed!! ,2
2,5,These fit really well. I'd definitely get more. ,2
2,5,Excellent!! 10/10 recommend. Kept my shoes from stinking through multiple wears so far. ,2
2,4,Good product,2
2,5,"These are a dream come true! So comfortable and they work exactly like they say they're going to! Why has no one before now made shoe liners that feel like socks without the annoyance of traditional no-show socks that either a) show, thus ruining the style of your shoe or b) fall off your feet and bunch up inside your shoe and c) make you angry and not able to wear your favorite cute shoes? Gekks are genius! ",2
2,4,It's a great idea but the material is a little rough under my feet... ,2
2,5,"fit great.  Love the color, and love that they are sustainable!
",2
2,4,"Overall I think they are nice. I like the fact that they stick and stay in the shoe (even though a part of mine became unstuck after the second wear, and the wash trick didn‚Äôt work so I had to peel back a layer to make it stick again). I don‚Äôt like that the toe part is not structured at all. I understand it needing to stretch some since it is for different sizes but in the pictures it looks like it stands up by itself and you slide in your toes (but in fact it is more like a flimsy pocket and you have to kind of lift up and put your toes in each time or it doesn‚Äôt want to go on your toes correctly). Lastly I like that they don‚Äôt smell but the special fibers they use leave a metal colored grayish residue on my toes mainly my big toe and second toe.   Like I said overall they are nice I haven‚Äôt had them long enough to see how long the fabric last, but they seem well made.  I would say they are worth trying and seeing how you like them for sure.",2
2,5,They work!! I'm a convert!,2
2,5,"This is my first pair of Gekks, and I love them. My feet sweaty like crazy when I don't wear socks, and the Grekks have saved my favorite shoes from becoming stinky. They're easy to put in, and I barely notice them on my feet.",2
2,4,I like them so far.,2
2,5,So far so good! Definitely staying put and living up to their promise! I'm very happy with the decision to try gekks.,2
2,5,Highly convenient and friendly,2
2,5,"Great!  Comfortable, stay in place, and don't show...  Perfect!",2
2,4,Useful ,2
2,5,I love these! I have very sweaty feet and I haven‚Äôt had a problem wearing these!!,2
2,4,"Pretty happy, so far. I wish the adhesive were a little stronger, but overall, pretty happy",2
2,4,"Excellent!

",2
2,5,Love them!,2
2,5,LOVE,2
2,5,Great product.  I highly recommend them.  They stay put unlike no show socks and make your shoes comfortable.  Buy them!,2
2,4,These are great! Will have to order more.,2
2,5,Love these! They make my ballet flats even more comfortable!,2
2,5,Excellent ,2
2,4,"I was very impressed at the design and how the sock stayed in place, it definitely works if you want a no show sock in your ballet flats which I have never once been able to find prior to this purchase - very happy about that! What I would love to see if possible as an improvement is the breathability of the material (my feet sweat in these but not in my cotton no show socks) and the ability of the edges in the bottom round part of the back corners to stay down as opposed to curl inward. This may just be me needing to wash them though. Overall seriously impressed with the product and I would definitely get these for heels as well.   ",2
2,5,I love my Gekks and will be ordering more for all my ballet flats!,2
2,5,These are amazing! ,2
2,5,This is exactly what I want,2
2,4,Please make them wider and longer for those of us with larger feet!,2
2,5,"They are an amazing product, no problems.  ",2
2,5,So comfortable ,2
2,5,Easy to install and easy to wear.  Just what I have been looking for!,2
2,5,"LOVE THESE. Seriously, these let me wear ballet flats again! Before, the socks either showed or had such ridiculously strong elastic to stay up that they were digging into my Achilles‚Äô tendon all day long. These sock liners stay put perfectly and keep the odor away - and I have super sweaty stinky feet!",2
2,5,"These are great! Easy to put in shoes and they stay in place, a great way to keep shoes smelling fresh and clean.",2
2,5,Good,2
2,5,"These ballet flats socks are amazing!  They are super comfortable, cooling, definitely no-show and easy to insert.  Will be buying more!",2
2,5,They work great in my shoes! Very pleased with my purchase. ,2
2,4,"I like the concept but it takes getting used to. The only thing I have a bit of a problem with, is the grainy texture it is not soft I got them to use with my Rothy‚Äôs flats because they are rough on my feet due to the nature of the material they are made with so, I have to wear something but the regular ones slip off and I thought gekks would solve the problem but Alas! They are almost just as rough! I guess is because of what they are made of which is sad because they work great! üòî ",2
2,5,Comfortable and stay put!,2
2,5,Love these!!!!!! ,2
2,4,Seem to work well. I see no difference between these and the one for heel? ,2
2,5,My wife copied me and she is glad she did. To date on of the only things she has admitted that I‚Äôm right about.,2
2,5,"Genius!!! They fit really well, are comfortable, and don‚Äôt budge ",2
2,5,"They are pretty awesome.  Wore them already, love them.",2
2,5,Super comfy - didn‚Äôt even feel like there was anything extra in my shoes!,2
2,4,"I like how they feel and fit in my shoes, and haven‚Äôt gotten blisters with them. I probably missed it in reading about them before I purchased them, but I didn‚Äôt realize that they are ‚Äúapplied‚Äù to the inside of the shoes, which is why they stay put. That works really well, but it makes me feel like I need to have a different pair for each pair of shoes, and they are very expensive.",2
2,5,5 star,2
2,4,Nice!,2
2,5,Love! These things are perfect and no show.,2
2,5,Fit in my shoes easily and stayed in. So much better than regular foot covers. Would definitely recommend.,2

2,5,Great,2
2,5,Great,2
2,5,Great arch support and super comfortable!,2
2,5,"Love love LOVE these. I'm back today to buy more. I've had these in my tieks now for 3 weeks, and have not had to do ANYTHING. No smell at all! Magic!!!",2
2,5,amazing!,2
2,5,They work great.  Invisible ,2
2,5,"I love gekks. As someone whose feet sweat a lot, these allow me to wear shoes barefoot.  Very comfortable, easy to install. ",2
2,5,"Love them - very comfy, absorb sweat and don‚Äôt take up too much room in my shoes. ",2
2,5,They are amazing,2
2,4,They work well. Will likely order more. ,2
2,5,"Great product!
",2
2,5,"Flats curl, but they're good",2
2,5,My girlfriend loves them. ,2
2,5,"i love all the options!  they get a bit sweaty with some leather shoes. But, it isn‚Äôt bad and totally worth  it. ",2
2,5,"i love all the options!  they get a bit sweaty with some leather shoes. But, it isn‚Äôt bad and totally worth  it. ",2
2,5,"I thought they had a very good fit, however I thought they were expensive. I will look else where for another purchase. ",2
2,5,"Love these socks, they really work! ",2
2,5,Love them but they were stiff when I first got them,2
2,5,These are incredible! I wear flats daily and they are often uncomfortable after a few hours because of the material. These inserts fit perfectly into my flats and are very comfortable. ,2
2,4,"So far overall I like Gekks... I am having a slight problem with the heal part staying fixed to the back of my shoe (from the start). Haven't washed them yet, so we'll see what happens. Still better than footies constantly falling off my feet!",2
2,5,"Easy to put in shoes, very comfortable.  No more trying to find shoe liners that stay put and don't show.  These are perfect!",2
2,5,They are great,2
2,5,The ballet flats are my favorite.,2
2,5,These are the best!,2
2,5,Perfect in flats. ,2
2,5,I love them!,2
2,5,"love them - stays put - reusable in other flats
",2
2,4,I was a bit skeptical when I ordered but did so because they were recommended by a friend.  They definitely fit better than most miners and do stay securely in place.  I'd buy again ,2

2,5,They were easy to put in and are feeling great! Love not having to worry about nylons or peds anymore.,2
2,5,So comfortable!,2
2,5,"They are very comfortable to wear, so glad I gave them a try. Will be  purchasing additional ones soon.",2
2,5,"I wore them all day, waiting for them to slip--they never did!  So far I absolutely love them!!",2
2,5,I've used by gekks every day for the last week and I absolutely love them so far! Absolutely no foot smell! Comfortable!,2
2,4,"Like them, just wish the toe part was also stuck to the shoe, but I guess that's just to allow toe flex.",2
2,5,Amazing!!! Worked even better than I could have imagined!!,2
2,5,These make my shoes so much more comfortable!,2
2,4,"Not sure what I expected but this wasn't it. I had to maneuver the little sock/sticker around for a few days until I finally got it into my shoe the way it needed to be so that all my toes were in the sock. That was my only complaint, that I had to mess with it until I got comfortable. I also with the toe area was bigger but I get that it's probably small to ensure that it's hidden for some other flats that don't have as much toe coverage as mine do. ",2
2,5,The ballet flats are awesome.  I don‚Äôt have to worry about the socks slipping ,2
2,5,These are such an awesome replacement for the little booties that never stay on your feet!,2
2,4,Cute packaging & clear instructions. It will take a little longer to know how they stand up to smell & hot days.  They require a little bit of fiddling when you put them on as the toe goes inside out when they come off.  The instructions say that you can wash them if needed but I imagine that‚Äôs the end of the adhesive (unless there‚Äôs some crazy magic they are not telling us about...),2
2,5,Fits well,2
2,5,"They are comfortable, easy to use and a lifesaver for my ballet flats. Being in SoCal means hot summers and that means sweaty feet when they are in leather ballet flats...gross!! However, with Gekks, my feet never sweat and remain a comfortable temperature in my ballet flats. This is a great product and I will definitely be purchasing more.",2
2,5,Perfect,2
2,5,These are perfect!! Will be buying more!,2
2,5,"These are awesome! Two weeks in an NO odor! Very comfortable too, don't even notice they are there!",2
2,5,Perfection! I plan to order a few more pairs for all my Tieks!,2
2,5,Work great,2
2,5,These work great,2
2,4,They were great for our trip to Italy. No slippage and no lumps or bumps. I  did wash once and the  sticky seems to already be less sticky so I am concerned about the longevity of that.,2
2,5,This is my fourth pair of GEKKS and I love them all. They truly do work exactly like they say they will. And there are no issues with creeping socks inside of shoes. I love that they are removeable to wash and then still work perfectly when reinserted. I remove them for the winter and wear regular socks. They go back in for summer. Could not be easier or more convenient. ,2
2,5,"Once I realized they can‚Äôt move from shoe to shoe, I did love them.",2
2,4,"Because the toe box is so short, I would like it a little wider to fit the toes. ",2
2,5,Great!,2
2,5,Great product!,2
2,4,"I've had a little trouble with getting the adhesive to stick but overall I like them, no more rubbing and sweaty feet inside my shoes. ",2
2,5,"As advertised...super comfy, stays in place and best of all, NO blisters from new flats!!",2
2,5,Absolutely love them! I no longer have stinky shoes and feet. :),2
2,5,LOVE THEM! Not longer have to wear those tiny little socks that pinch my toes! Changed my life! Thank you! ,2
2,5,I love my Gekks for ballet flats!!  These saved my favorite pair of shoes!!,2
2,5,Love them. I ordered more because they stay put and my feet are 100% comfy and sweat-free! Now I have enough Gekks for all of my flats and loafers!,2
2,5,These worked very well. No sliding!,2
2,5,Love these shoes.,2
2,5,Brilliant. Really comfy and easy to insert,2
2,4,So far my shoes aren't smelly and the socks don't show. The only issue is that I need to buy a pair of gekks for each of my flats :o and that's a lot of gekks. I would love a bulk pack of ballet flats as a permanent option because I don't feel like I need gekks for anything other than flats.,2
2,5,Brilliant. Really comfy and easy to insert,2
2,5,"Comfy, perfect!  I love my shoes again!",2
2,4,These Gekks stayed well in. Awesome!,2
2,5," So comfortable, doesn't slip off and doesn't show.  Love them!!!",2
2,5,"Very easy to install in shoes, no show, love them!",2
2,5,wonderful!,2
2,4,Very comfortable but a little awkward to install.  They do work as score.,2
2,4,These do everything they promise and they definitely saved a pair of shoes for me that were previously unwearable! I only wish the hand sanitizer trick to renew the adhesive had worked for me. The heels became unstuck a few times on mine.,2
2,5,"Was a little difficult to place in shoes, but once there, they are great as Geeks take the place of shoe liners (peds) and you don't have to worry about them showing out of your shoes.

",2
2,5,These are freakin awesome ,2
2,5,Fabulous!,2
2,5,They stay in place and are comfortable,2
2,4,"They work. They don‚Äôt slip. I have to say they‚Äôre kinda tricky to get my toes in them just right so that I doesn‚Äôt slip off my little toe or just attach to my big toe, but once I groom it right on my toes, I don‚Äôt even notice they‚Äôre there. ",2
2,5,great solution for ultra-low flats!,2
2,5,Love them!,2
2,5,they are great!,2
2,4,Love them ,2
2,5,I loved the ballet flat Geeks.  They fit perfectly into my shoes and we're super comfortable.  They stay in place.  I will be ordering more ,2
2,5,"Works perfectly in my flats. Even with side cut outs they are camouflaged and comfortable, no bunching. Helps keep my feet dry and my heels don‚Äôt slip out. Love them!",2
2,5,"these liners really work well!  I was a bit skeptical at first but after having tried them, I'm thrilled at how well they work and feel.  I will be ordering more.  Thanks for a great product.",2
2,5,Surprised by how well they stay in the shoe and the toe doesn't slip around.,2
2,5,So far so good. They protect my pinky toe from the blisters I normally get and they keep the stink off my feet!,2
2,5,Amazing!,2
2,5,"Simple directions, very comfortable!",2
2,5,Great!,2
2,4,I really like these shoes. They are comfortable despite the lack of real support that I usually prefer and need due to leg injuries. I am not sure I can walk miles in them but they are perfect for the office. They are not too tight and didn't rub and amazingly the back didn't start wearing down immediately which most flats seem to do. I am impressed. If you could figure out how to make them have a bit more support they would be 5 full stars because they are great.  ,2
2,5,I have had these for about a week now and they are fantastic so far. They were very easy to insert and are very comfortable. ,2
2,5,"Why didn't I buy these sooner?! Wearing them all day in Texas heat, and my feet barely sweat with NO ODOR in my leather flats. Time to invest in more for pairs I wear every day!",2

2,5,"Amazing!  I'm 71 years old and we never, ever wore shoes without hose or socks.  Now I can still look in fashion but not get that icky feeling of sweat i.e., sticky shoes!

",2
2,5,This is what I've needed all my life! I got a pair of Tieks flats and felt awful for not wearing them enough. I just was not comfortable in them with no socks. Any socks I wore either were small and didn't show but fell off or didn't fall off but showed. These are the solution and I've worn my flats more in the past couple weeks with these than I have in the past year!,2
2,4,They work well,2
2,5,They are easy to put in and seem to be sticking where they should.  Thank you ,2
2,5,Exactly what I was looking for! 3 weeks and still no smell & are where I placed them on day 1 no adjustment needed!!!,2
2,5,"love them!!! I need to order more.

2,5,"I was skeptical, but they are stay in-place and are comfortable.",2

2,5,fantastic.  Heels are fantastic as well - buying more,2

2,5,They fit great inside of my Tieks!,2
2,5,These are great. No more blisters!,2
2,5,I love my Gekks! I am on my feet at work all day and these have made the day so much more comfortable for me. I love cute shoes but had not found a way to wear them without worrying about rubbing or the door that comes when you don‚Äôt wear socks. I‚Äôm buying more because I am a fan.,2
2,5,Love it,2
2,5,I really like them. They really don‚Äôt show and they don‚Äôt stink. ,2
2,5,"Absolutely LOVE these! They NEVER show, and you know how the ""no show"" socks always slide and at some point you're pushing them into your shoes. The ""sticky"" really sticks and does not come loose even after multiple wearings. Love, love, love these!",2
2,5,"I love them,  but I wish that the edge's binding was thinner!
I wore them today and they left an uncomfortable indentation across my great toes/foot. ",2
2,5,I think that they are great.,2

2,5,I love them. They fit perfectly in my flats and don't make them too tight. very comfortable.,2
2,5,"LOVE them, thank you!!!",2
2,5,Love love love these gekks. Definitely recommend them.,2
2,5,"Love, love",2
2,5,"Amazing product. Easy to put in your shoes and so, so comfortable!",2
2,4,"They're pretty good. Unfortunately, they did rip the insides of my shoes when I removed them to wash them. On one pair of shoes a layer of sticky stayed inside the shoe when I removed the Gekks to wash them. So, they work as advertised, but don't remove as well as advertised I'd say. ",2
2,4,"Love them - just concerned about how many times you can ""refresh"" the adhesive (with peeling another layer off) before there's none left. ",2
2,5,"Super happy with these! They're so easy to place (and re-place if need be), and I'm amazed that there's no smell in my flats anymore! Such a relief!!",2
2,5,"Great fit. Very comfortable. A must need for all your shoes
",2
2,5,Work great!,2
2,5,These are awesome and will be buying for all my flats. ,2
2,5,I live in ballet flats 80% of the year.  These are complete game changers.  And everytime I see someone in flats I tell them about them.  I feel like I'm doing a public service.  So worth it.,2
2,5,"Love the ballet flat Gekks!  I've put them in my everyday black flats and have been wearing them for several weeks.  Adhesive is staying put, but my only comment would be I wish they had just a wee bit more toe coverage. Maybe it's just my size 11 foot? If I'm on my feet a lot, sometimes the toe part will slip off.  But overall I love these!  Best no-see socks I've tried yet!",2

2,5,Works perfectly ,2
2,5,These work perfect in my dress ballerinas.  They stay put and prevent any chafing.  Great!,2
2,5,"I have tried so many different no-show socks to use in my Tieks. Nothing worked....the socks always peeked out of the shoes somewhere, or slipped off my heel and bunched up under my foot. It was so frustrating. Then I tried Gekks and they are perfect, praise God. Thanks for inventing these!",2

2,5,"I love gekks!  I purchased only one pair to see if I thought they were worth the price.  Loved them enough to purchased 4 more!  I was tired of battling the ""flat stink"" of my work shoes. Gekks stopped the stink plus I don't have to search for liners or socks.  ",2
2,5,"They have been awesome. Fully expected them to have not met expectations, but instead they have exceeded. Will be getting more!",2
2,4,"These are the best solution I‚Äôve found. The material is nice and it‚Äôs easy to slide right into them. Sometimes I feel the edge of the liner under the ball of my foot. It doesn‚Äôt hurt; I just feel it. That said, I probably will buy again. ",2
2,5,Definitely the best: it stays in place and is comfy,2
2,5,"This is my first pair of Gekks, and I love them. My feet sweaty like crazy when I don't wear socks, and the Grekks have saved my favorite shoes from becoming stinky. They're easy to put in, and I barely notice them on my feet.",2
2,5,I bought them for my daughter‚Äôs toeks for her outdoor wedding so her feet would stay dry. She loved them. I also bought myself a pair for my tieks that I wore to the rehearsal. They were perfect! Kept my feet comfortable & dry!,2
2,5,Great for flats,2
2,5,These are amazing and totally worth the money. I won't wear another set of ballet flats without them.,2
2,5,"These are the BEST!  I have 2 pair of Tieks and have had issues with my feet ""sticking"" to the leather insole and no other shoe liner worked with them.  LOVE my gekks in these.",2
2,4,perfect,2
2,5,"The ballet flats were my first purchase of Gekks, and I am thrilled with them! So easy to ""install"" and very comfortable - I forgot they were there. The weather here is already hot, and it was wonderful to not have sticky feet in my shoes. Thanks!",2
2,4,They stay put! It was so nice to have a sock that didn't  roll off my heel.  Only trouble was getting my pinky toes in as I do have wide width feet.  I will be buying another pair.,2
2,5,Easy to install and comfortable to wear.,2
2,5,These are great !  ,2
2,5,Love them!!!,2
2,5,I love these Gekks to go with my ballet flats! ,2
2,5,"I almost got rid of one pair of my flats because the shoe was rubbing a blister by my big toe, but the ballet flats work beautifully. I wear my flats all the time now. ",2
2,5,"Wish I would have known about these a long time ago! These are the greatest. I have a pair in all of my Tieks and  think the Gekks should be sold with the Tieks. They really are ""no show"" and the best part...my shoes and feet don't stink!  So blessed I had a patient tell me about these. ",2
2,5,Also great!!,2
2,4,They were great- just don‚Äôt know how to get it to be sticky in another shoe! ,2
2,4,"They were comfortable , very strong adhesive. I ripped the sole of my shoe removing them.",2
2,5,Very comfortable,2
2,4,I liked my first order better with the Velcro like attachment. I feel like these won‚Äôt last as long with the adhesive. ,2
2,5,Easy to use. ,2
2,5,I love them! They are just what I needed. (The company stands behind their product too. They took care of a small problem with one sock),2
2,5,"I have to admit, I was skeptical at first, but I have been totally won over. This is such a clever product! I love being able to slip on my shoes and go, and these socks feel totally soft and comfortable against my skin. I was worried that there wouldn't be enough coverage to prevent blisters on my toes or at my heels, but nope - even after my almost-3-mile round trip to and from work, all is well. I'll be back for more!",2
2,5,Stay put in my shoes & comfy. ,2
2,5,"These are ingenious shoe liners. I'm on my third wear today. They make my flats more comfortable, across the board. I don't feel them anywhere on my feet - no seams. They don't show. They don't slip. They don't shift. Caveats: I have not yet washed them or removed them to put in other shoes, so I cannot speak to those elements yet. ",2
2,5,I love them!!!! They completed exceeded my expectations and I am currently waiting on my second shipment.,2
2,5,Love them!  Perfect fit!,2
2,5,Amazing! Super easy install!,2
2,5,Gekks are perfect and fill a need for those of us who hate to have our feet sticking to the bottom of flats! Will definitely reorder for more flats and have already recommended multiple times!,2
2,5,I‚Äôve tried a gazillion different brands. Gekks is the only one that works for me.,2
2,5,Feels comfortable and doesn‚Äôt smell,2
2,5,"I really love these! I was leery at first, because I wasn't sure if they really worked.  But I've had them for about a month, wear them daily, machine washed them, reused them, and they li e up to the hype!",2
2,5,Work great!,2
2,5,"I love the Ballet Flats Gekks because they just cover my toes and work well with Mary Jane shoes and ballet flats. You don't see them at all, they don't slip, same great comfortable wear, and no odor. I love them!",2
2,5,These are incredible and I am a true skeptic!,2
2,5,Surprised how easy to put in and worked perfectly!!!,2
2,5,Absolutely love them!,2
2,4,"Amazing on ballerina flat, doesnt show at all, which i love. But it was not easy to remove off the shoe when i want to wash it, also i used once and the sticky part is coming off the sock. ",2
2,5,They are very comfortable and fit perfectly in my shoes! ,2
2,4,"Bought these for my granddaughter who hates wearing socks with her shoes.  So far she‚Äôs using them, so that‚Äôs a win!",2
2,5,"I was hesitant to order because of the price, but after reading all the positive reviews, I decided to try them. I‚Äôm so glad I did, they are as awesome as promised! I waited to write this review for about 2 months so I could really get a chance to see how they hold up & I‚Äôm happy to report that I have yet to wash them (no smell!) & they have remained exactly where I placed them without bunching or any readjusting needed. You really don‚Äôt feel them at all in your shoe! And no more smelly, sweaty, squishy toes!!! Yes ",2
2,5,A smart idea that solved a big problem!!!,2
2,5,I wish I would have known about gekks sooner. REALLY loving them!,2
2,5,Just as promised!,2
2,5,"I have to admit - when I opened the box and saw the socks, I thought they looked super stupid and pretty useless.  The box sat on my counter for over a week waiting to be returned.  Then, I decided to just try one pair since I knew it was going to gradually heat up during the day.  

Holy. Moly.  These socks are game changers for sweated feeted folks like myself. They don't slip at all which was my main fear.  Better yet, at the end of the day, when I took my ballet flats off, I didn't immediately have to rinse off my feet for fear of stinking up my house. THANK YOU, GEKKS.",2
2,5,"These are VERY nice in Tieks.  I'd been using insoles, but these are much much better!  LOVE them, definitely ordering more!",2
2,5,They work just as advertised!,2
2,5,They‚Äôre PERFECT!  But a little pricey.,2
2,5,"Yes the inserts were everything that was advertised. I hv not washed them yet, but I don‚Äôt expect any problems. Very comfortable & no heel slips!!",2
2,5,Great!,2
2,4,"I like the Gekks, but sometimes they feel like there is a wtinkle ",2
2,5,Highly recommend the ballet flats. I got gekks to go in black flats (Tori Burch) and they fit perfectly. No more clicking noises when I walk and the gekks are so comfortable and are out of sight!,2
2,4,"Seem to be working well. Placement into the heel was a bit tricky - due to shape of the heel, I think.",2
2,5,"I love them...  I can't stand wearing shoes without some sort of footie, but could never find any that didn't show, slip off my heal, or bind across my toes...  The ballet flat shoe liners are outstanding... Not sure what I did before I had them!",2

2,5,Love them! I bought a pair to wear with my Rothy's and they work great!  ,2
2,5,"Easy to install, comfortable all day!",2
2,5,Great fit and very comfortable in my flats. Really like how they feel because my feet sweat a lot and they absorb well.,2
2,5,Excellent quality my feet didn‚Äôt stink at all!,2
2,5,They were easy to put on and do not move or bunch.  ,2
2,5,Love them! I bought a pair to wear with my Rothy's and they work great!  ,2
2,5,Looove my geeks for ballet flats! They fit perfectly and you never have to worry if they‚Äôll show! A great product indeed!,2
2,5,I can actually wear ballet flats again.  Gekks are amazing!,2
2,5,They stay in place and don't slip around in my flats.  They help with odor control and make the shoes more comfortable.,2
2,5,Love these!! ,2
2,5,Love them ,2
2,5,"My new Gekks are great, exactly as described. They are comfortable, easy to place, no slipping and sliding, and odor-free. A great invention. Highly recommend. ",2
2,5,These are great. I have naturally sweaty feet and these keep my feet and shoes dry and odor free. I would definitely recommend! Plus no annoying slipping. THE BEST.,2
2,4,"I LOVE these! I have to admit that I read several horrible reviews about the customer service and shipping times but took a chance on them. I think those complaints are due to them being a young company. The shipping time was a few days longer than expected but I think it was worth the wait.

These are great - they stay in place all day, I never have to adjust them (i even forget I'm wearing them) and they are hidden even in my lowest cut ballet flats!  I'm a big fan. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was they aren't 100% smell deodorizing. When I take them off after a long day, they do smell a little bit but not too bad. I have yet to try and wash them - hopefully it's as easy as the instructions say. You'll love these footies!",2
2,5,These make putting on my ballet flats so easy! And the great thing is my shoes will last longer now. I know slipping no show socks.,2
2,5,Very happy,2
2,5,Excellent fit and comfortable all day long.,2
2,4,I love them! They do seem to stretch after a few wears and then make a little bit of a bunch under my foot.,2
2,5,Stays in place and helps prevent smelly shoes!,2
2,5,These worked great!,2
2,4,"I liked them, but I would like them better if the front area around the toes also attached. The rest is well connected but that part moves and rolls up. ",2
2,4,"I liked them, but I would like them better if the front area around the toes also attached. The rest is well connected but that part moves and rolls up. ",2
2,5,Gekks are great!  They don‚Äôt show in my ballet flats and are very comfortable.  I can easily move them from one pair of shoes to another.  I tried one pair and loved them so I ordered three more.,2
2,5,Easy to use. Haven‚Äôt tried washing them yet. ,2
2,5,these are going to work great for my flats!,2
2,5,"After using them in one pair of Vionic ballet flats, I ordered another pair which is on its way!!  I love how they keep my feet from sweating but are so thin, the fit of the shoe is not affected.  Great product!!",2
2,4,I like them so far but haven't had to switch them or wash them yet.,2
2,5,"Worked as advertised. Comfortable and keep my feet less stanky than without. They do not change the current odor of your shoes, unfortunately. ",2
2,5,Fantastic liners that keep feet from slipping inside shoes with no show.,2
2,5,Love them! ,2
2,5,Great product! Ready to buy more!,2
2,4,"I was pleasantly surprised by these! I have a few pairs of super expensive flats that I just could not wear because the leather and bare foot combo made my feet super stanky. I've tried inserts, baby powder, you name it, but I eventually gave up and stopped wearing them. The Gekks I ordered do the job PERFECTLY. They're comfy, easy to install and completely eliminate foot odor. My only complaint is that they feel a little slippery to walk in. The toe doesn't have adhesive, so if I curl my toes the wrong way, the sock gets all bunched up and I have to take the shoe off and re-adjust. And sometimes when I walk I'm afraid my foot is going to slip out of my shoe. That said, they're 90% great and I'm glad to have solved the problem so I'll definitely be ordering more for all my flats and sneakers!",2
2,5,Comfortable and stay in place.  No slipping.,2
2,5,Absolutely love them,2
2,5,I love them.  Fit perfect in my flats that I needed some socks.  They don‚Äôt show which is exactly what I wanted.,2
2,5,"Comfortable, stays in place and feels nice on my feet.  Shoes do not stink!",2
2,5,"I love, love, love these.  It's exactly what I needed.",2
2,4,I love them but the heel tends to slip down just a bit. ,2
2,4,"The socks are great. However, getting the socks took forever. ",2
2,4,Very well made and comfortable,2
2,4,"Almost perfect. I love that you can't see the gekks at all, and the bottom part seems to stay firmly in place. The only problem is that my ""pinky toes"" keep slipping out, which is bearable but a little uncomfortable.",2
2,5,They are a much better option than going sockless and were so easy to apply to my shoes.,2
2,4,it took a little bit to get used to them.  but i liked them,2
2,5,Worth the price for a truly no show fit,2
2,5,They fit my Tieks perfectly! ,2
2,4,Overall really good product. I liked having a liner for a lot of shoes that I usually have to wear barefoot. Kept my feet warmer and I like that they can be washed. The stickiness definitely went away with the very first shoe swap and was not revived with hand sanitizer as suggested. I will try washing and see if it gets better. Otherwise just wearing them without much stickiness still works. ,2
2,5,just as described...I like them!,2
2,5,Such a relief to find socks that don‚Äôt show and don‚Äôt fall down when I wear them with my ballet flats!  They are comfortable and stay in place. I will get more of these kind of socks!,2

2,5,I really like Gekks! I was trying to find the perfect no show soaks for my ballet shoes - but no matter what you could still see the soaks and it was so annoying - I gave the gekks a shot and I am so grateful I did! This is a genius! ,2
2,5,they're exactly what I was looking for!,2
2,5,I really like them. They fit well in my teiks. I‚Äôm definitely going to order more.,2
2,5,They work perfectly in my wife's Tieks! ,2
2,5,Love my ballet flat gekks -- they have put new life into my old flats! ,2
2,5,Greatest invention ever! Comfortable and now my shoes don‚Äôt sqeek when my feet get sweaty. ,2
2,4,"I like them, but I ordered 3 pair and received only one.  Perhaps the other two were shipped separately?",2
2,5,The best and so much better than the old pets.,2
2,5,Fabulous product. ,2
2,4,"These socks are such an upgrade to the little footie socks I always wore before. I never worry about them slipping off, and it‚Äôs so nice to not have to dig through my sock drawer for tiny socks all the time. I tried to save money and just bought one pair of socks and extra sets of grippers with the intention of just changing out the socks depending on which shoe I was wearing that day. Although this could work fine, I would recommend just buying multiple pairs of socks; the Velcro-like material that keeps the socks attached to the grippers is pretty strong, and it‚Äôs a bit of an ordeal to change out the socks every time I wear a different pair of shoes. Overall, such a great purchase! ",2

2,5,Love them!!!!,2
2,5,"I love them, but I'm still stretching them.",2

2,4,amazing!,2
2,5,Super comfy and love how versatile!,2
2,4,"I like the concept and the fit. I took off one star because the Velcro has to stay adhered inside one pair of shoes, making each pair of Gekks only good for one pair of shoes. I did go ahead and order a second pair but it would be nice if they sold the Velcro attachments for extra shoes so that you could switch out the sock liner part into other shoes. ",2

2,5,They were very easy to stick into my ballet flats and they stay! I plan on ordering another pair for sneakers! ,2
2,4,Easy to put in and very comfortable! My shoes don't end up sweaty anymore!,2
2,5,"These socks are great!  No more slipping, sliding socks. I love them, thank you Gekksüòäüòâ",2
2,4,"Socks are great, but the adhesive to stick them into your shoes is awful and difficult to separate, resulting in the adhesive sticking to itself and losing its stickiness. If it weren‚Äôt for this problem, these socks are awesome. ",2
2,5,"Love the Ballet Flat Gekks! No more slipping socks and no more ""stinky"" shoes!",2
2,5,Love these socks. They are perfect! ,2
2,5,They work great! Definitely will be buying more to put in all my flats and slip ons that require no show socks. Fixes the problem with no show socks sliding down and causing problems in general!,2
2,5,Loved the ballet flat gekks -really worked amd were very comfortable!,2
2,5,Love them!,2
2,4,Wouldn't say they are super comfy. Definitely feels like I'm wearing crumply socks in my flats. Putting your feet in them is also a bit tricky. Its not just like sliding your foot into your shoe as per usual; you have to fuss with the sock a bit. But I do like that my feet don't smell at all! That's a HUGE plus for me. ,2
2,5,Great!,2
2,5,Loved them!!  They made my shoes SO comfortable!   They didn‚Äôt slip down at the heel.  Will definitely buy more for all my flats!!,2
2,5,I LOVED my Gekks! My feet sweat terribly in any shoe that I can‚Äôt wear socks and I have had no luck with store bought ‚Äúno show‚Äù socks. Gekks solves my problem! Not having to worry about ruining my MK flats from sweaty feet is awesome! Putting them in my shoe was fast and easy and they stay put! Definitely worth the price to save my shoes!,2
2,5,Awesome! Love them!,2
2,5,Better than I expected. Will be ordering more.,2
2,5,Fit my Tieks perfectly and act just as described,2
2,5,"Fit perfectly, very convenient! No more searching for tiny no show socks ",2
2,4,Love them. I only had 1 issue when I put them in my shoes. One of the heels would not stick it was like it had no adhesive. But I peeled the next layer from the backing and it worked perfectly,2
2,5,Great!,2
2,5,The inserts keep my feet comfortable and dry during the day while wearing my flats! Super satisfied!,2
2,4,"Nicer than regular socks, but I still got blisters on the back of my heels. Haven't tried washing them yet (wondering how long I can hold out before I need to do that), so I don't know how well they'll stick back down after a round of removal.  ",2
2,5,"Way comfier than expected, and they really stay out! They also keep my feet warm, which was unexpected. Two thumbs up!",2
2,5,"Ingenious!  Where have these been my whole life?!  I really didn‚Äôt expect these to work -(I have foot issues) well.....pie in my face, they DID!!  In fact they worked so well, I ordered MORE!! If you're a skeptic like me and on the fence about ordering, just DO IT! You won‚Äôt regret it. I would give these 4.75 starts actually, a teeny, little issue with the adhesive sticking to worn shoes, which isn‚Äôt really a Gekks issue. They still totally work, but you just need to be careful when removing them from the Velcro, as the adhesive loosens from the worn material inside the shoe. Stop reading reviews and just PURCHASE SOME! ",2
2,5,Gekks more than superseded my expectations! This is the best product I have ever used. I will never wear flats again without Gekks! Thank you Gekks for this life changing product!,2
2,5,Yes! I need to order more!! I love them ,2
2,5,Love them,2
2,5,I have had these in my ballet flats for a week and I notice that my feet smell so much better and I do not even notice that the Gekks are in my shoes.  I haven't washed them yet.,2
2,5,"They're surprisingly great!  Once I overcame the somewhat complicated directions (they're actually pretty easy to install), I very much enjoyed the freedom from those very annoying little pedi things!  Great to be able to just slip into my shoes and fell as if you had socks on!",2
2,5,Awesome ,2
2,5,"Great product!  Easy to use, comfortable.",2
2,5,"Didn‚Äôt believe the hype but they are well worth it. Buying another pair now 
",2
2,4,"so far, they're good. not sure if i installed it incorrectly but it's been hard to walk without my shoes slipping off since installing them. i may just need to break them in. ",2
2,5,I love them! ,2
2,5,This is the best out of the 3 items in the pack; works amazing with TOM's and other flat shoes.,2
2,5,"I have been delightfully surprised how well the ballet flat Gekks have been working. They stay in place and I am completely unaware of them through the day...I never think about having to readjust my sock. So far, I am very pleased. ",2
2,5,Love them! They work perfect for my Toms ballet flats. ,2
2,5,I love these! What a great invention!!,2
2,5,These are the ONLY socks I‚Äôve ever been able to comfortably wear with my flats. They don‚Äôt slip and don‚Äôt show. Not even a little bit! ,2
2,5,My new Gekks are fantastic! I‚Äôm going to buy a closet pack of flats!,2
2,5,Love them!,2
2,5,Exactly as advertised! They fit great and stay put!,2

2,5,great concept,2
2,5,Love these! They‚Äôre easy to install and work great!,2

2,4,Very comfortable and fit well in my shoes. Only down side was inserting them was difficult. ,2
2,5,They do everything that is promised!,2
2,4,"They stay in my flats with no trouble.  I am an 8 C width and got the size that goes to 8.5 and they just fit.  I would have liked a little more coverage but don‚Äôt think the larger size would have worked.  So, all in all I like them and would consider repurchasing.",2
2,5,I love my ballet insert. They work great.,2
2,5,Work great with my Tieks!!,2
2,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them! I've only had them about a week, but can already tell I'm going to truly like them. They are easy to install, they're simple to use, & so glad you all make extra gripper sets. I've told several people about them & will order more soon. Thank you! These have been a welcomed relief to constantly changing out shoe liners & not finding any ""no show"" footies that actually work!",2
2,5,Surpassed my expectations.  Now I wonder what I'm going to do if I ever can't find these in the future.,2
2,5,Love them!!! üòä,2
2,4,love the idea and fit well in my shoes  would have given 5 stars if there was a all cotton option on the sock for better breathablity,2
2,5,Very comfy & fitting,2
2,4,Love them! Brilliant idea and easy to put in. Shipping was slow though.,2
2,5,"Sharing advice I got from customer service - I wear a women's 8.5 or 9, and the large was the right size for me, they fit great. I'm putting these in as many shoes as possible! They make wearing shoes without socks so much more comfortable. Installation is a little difficult the first time, but the videos make it easy to figure out. Also, the first time you wear them, you will probably have to adjust a little, but after that, they will be set and comfortable.

One feature that I wish the ballet flats had in particular is a wider coverage of the heel portion of the shoe. These help prevent blisters at the very back of my heel, but my usual problem areas are further to the sides, where the gekks don't cover. 

But overall, very happy and I will be getting more. ",2
2,5,These are great - just what I needed,2
2,5,Loved them,2
2,5,I love them! Exactly what I was looking for thank you,2
2,5,Much better than shoe liners!,2
2,4,A good alternative to low socks or bare feet.,2
2,5,These took a little getting used to but I have really enjoyed them!  My shoes smell way less now! ,2
2,5,Love that these are so convenient to always have hidden in the shoes! Keep feet warm and dry!,2
2,5,"Love them! The socks are comfortable and they don't show!

2,4,Good so far however I didn't realize it's a Velcro like system and unfortunately they don't stick to one of the shoes I bought to use them in. ,2

2,5,the perfect solution.,2
2,4,"They are very clever and I can see how they would normally work, but I  have a very wide foot and only 4 toes fit in the top of the sock",2

2,4,Nice fit. But wish they could be used in more than one pair of shoes ,2
2,5,"I really didn't believe I could find a no-show sock that didn't show, let alone a comfy one that also eradicated the icky smell in some of my flats that I'd been wearing without socks. Gekks changed that. I bought two pairs for my two favorite pairs of flats. They're awesome! They were easy to put in my shoes with the included instructions, they really don't show, they're comfortable, and my shoes no longer stink! Facebook ads are the new infomercials, but this product is one of those rare products that really delivers on its promises. I will definitely be buying more Gekks in the future! ",2
2,4,"I like them a lot, I just wish they either weren't so expensive or you could (more easily) put the same pair into different shoes.. I'd like to buy a couple more pairs for my other work flats, but $18 is a lot.
They do work well, and are comfortable.  I don't find myself taking my shoes off as often as I did without them, so I think they work to not make my feet and toes as hot.",2
2,4,These are a waste of money. They did not work at all.,2
2,4,"I was so surprised! I was very doubtful, but they are so neat! Love them! ",2
2,4,"These are the greatest invention since sliced bread, in my opinion!!!",2
2,4,They were difficult to install since I had elastic straps coming off the heal of the shoe.,2
2,4,Awesome,2
2,5,I absolutely loved these! I will be ordering more. ,2
2,5,I absolutely loved these! I will be ordering more. ,2
2,5,I LOVE them. The way they stay in your shoes and do not slip AND are very low profile and don‚Äôt show is FABULOUS!  I‚Äôve shown them to all of my girlfriends who also love them!,2
2,5,I LOVE them. The way they stay in your shoes and do not slip AND are very low profile and don‚Äôt show is FABULOUS!  I‚Äôve shown them to all of my girlfriends who also love them!,2
2,5,"Comfortable and easily transferred to other shoes.  They stay in place well.
",2
2,4,Good,2
2,5,"Just what I needed. I have a great pair of ballet flats that I wear all the time. I live in the south and, well, sweaty feet happens. Especially in the summer. Problem solved. Since I don‚Äôt wear socks most of the year this is a wonderful solution. Thanks! ",2
2,4,Great!,2
2,4,"The piece that goes in the back of the shoe needs a tab or a cut -took me awhile to be able to peel the backing off.  Otherwise, they work as advertised.",2
2,4,"For the first time ever, I am able to work all day in ballet flats without adjusting my footie socks every hour!",2
2,5,I should have bought them sooner!,2
2,5,Love these!!!,2
2,5,Was able to wear shoes that I could never wear for longer than an hr all day. ,2
2,5,Love them!,2
2,5,I love them and they are they best ones I've ever purchased for my ballet flats.,2
2,4,Surprisingly comfy. But a bit expensive. ,2
2,5,What an great product. It definitely takes away the noises my flats used to make when my foot stuck to them. Also like that they will help keep them deodorized and fresh.,2
2,5,These are awesome! They do what they're supposed to do. ,2
2,5,"Pretty cool. Week 1 Of  wear and they‚Äôve stayed put! Only weirdness is first putting it on, the toe feels a little crumpled. But after a few tor wiggles it‚Äôs fine!",2
2,4,"I like them, but I wish they could transfer to other flats!
",2
2,5,great!  life-changing!,2
2,4,I wore them for one day so far. My feet seemed more sweaty than usual. My toes also kind of felt like I was wearing socks that were too big for my feet. I am going to keep them in my shoes and try to get used to them.,2
2,5,Comfortable and relatively simple to install.,2
2,5,I love them!! They fit perfectly in my Tieks! I will be purchasing more.,2
2,5,I love me gekks,2
2,4,they have worked so far,2
2,5,Works well without any slippage!,2
2,5,"Overall, I am very pleased with my Gekks! They fit perfectly in my Tieks, and I don‚Äôt have to worry about sweaty feet or getting blisters. The shipping took well over 2 weeks, which was disappointing, and it took me sending multiple emails and Facebook messages to get a response, but other than that I like them and plan on ordering more in the future.",2
2,5,I'm very pleased with them and will be ordering more for the rest of my flats.,2
2,5,"Really makes a difference with my shoes.  Took me a few minutes to figure out how they fit but once I tested it, fit like a charm.  Will buy more.  ",2
2,5,These were perfect for my flats which have a cutout,2
2,5,Gekks are an amazing solution for being able to go sockless wearing ballet flats! I can't live without them!,2
2,4,What a great product!! ,2
2,5,Different ,2
2,5,Love them. so comfortable!,2
2,4,I think I need to buy more,2
2,5,They are great! No more sticky feet :),2
2,5,"Quite easy to install, and I've worn the shoes a few times so far.  No smell, not much sweating, and barely noticeable when you first put them on.  I will be ordering more for future shoes!",2
2,5,Love my ballet flats gelks. They are the only liner that cuts down on foot odor. ,2
2,5,work great,2
2,4,Make going sockless great especially on the feet. Little problem in the heel. Wish they were interchangeable ,2
2,5,Fantastic!,2
2,5,It's still pretty cold here so I haven't had the chance to wear them. I tried them walking around inside a little but not all day. I hope they work out!,2
2,4,I‚Äôve been really inpresssed so far. They seem to be controlling odor really well. ,2
2,5,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Gekks when I ordered them, but I thought they were worth a try since I wear ballet flats to work all summer. I also work outside, so that means sweaty flats all summer! I admit I haven't really tested the stink factor very much just yet, but I'm sold on how much more comfortable my brand new flats instantly became when I put these liners in. So much so that I didn't realize I'd actually bought my shoes too small until I put the Gekks in. They relieved all the pressure points causing blisters so the only pain I was feeling was my toe hurting from too small shoes. Thanks to Gekks I won't be suffering in too small shoes waiting for them to ""break in"" now. I'll be trying more styles for some of my other shoes soon!",2
2,5,i love my Gekks! ordered three more pairs,2
2,4,They met my expectations ,2
2,5,Love them!,2
2,4,"my shoes are much more comfortable with the Gekks.  they stay in place really well and I don't feel like I'm sliding around in my shoes like I do when I wear separate ""no show"" socks.  Could be a little more odor controlling (I don't notice a difference at all), but hopefully they'll withstand a few washings which will certainly be better than nothing at all.",2
2,5,They really do stay in place!,2
2,5,love the inserts. shipping time was a little slow but it was worth the wait.,2
2,5,"They‚Äôre amazing! I‚Äôve wasted so much money on socks for my flats. They would always fall off, rip, or get lost. Gekks have exceeded my expectation! They stay on my feet all day and I never have to fadjust them. ",2
2,5,"I bought three ballet flat inserts for my Tieks and I LOVE them.  They're easy to put in, they stay in and are so much better than going without socks or using those awful flat socks that end up showing/peeking out.  They perform as advertised and keep my shoes fresh/protected.  ",2
2,5,I like them,2
2,5,I like them,2
2,5,Wore these on a 14 hour travel day (there and back home again). Fantastic product so comfortable and NO stinky feet!,2
2,4,Loved them until I tried to take them out of the shoes and transfer them to other shoes.  One of them pulled the insole out of the shoe.  I used the hand sanitizeer but it didn't stick nearly as well as the first time.  Still - I have bought more.,2
2,5,"They make textured shoes (a brand made from recycled bottles) comfortable for my toes.  My toes used to get sore from the texture, but now they feel perfect!",2
2,5,Very comfortable ,2
2,5,Very comfortable Don t even know there in the shoe.,2
2,5,Love them!!,2
2,5,I love them so much I came back for more. ,2
2,5,Honestly a game changer for wearing flats. So glad you cracked the code! ,2
2,4,"Neat concept, but lacking in quality.",2
2,4,Not very easy as portrayed to put in shoes but work well once they are placed.,2
2,5,"The Ballet Flats are awesome!  Not what I expected - I wasn't expecting the adhesive. They work great.  I'll try another style, too.",2
2,4,"Love these! a little difficult to put in at first but so comfortable and look great.  I wish they were a bit cheaper, but they a e great",2
2,5,"Protect my shoes AND my feet. Stay in place and don't show!  Win, win! ",2
2,5,I‚Äôm very impressed!,2
2,5,Love love love these! ,2
2,5,Love how well they stay in the shoes! Super comfortable!,2
2,5,I love them and hope to get more for all my flats!!!,2
2,4,Work great,2
2,5,"These are great. I ordered a large, 9 1/2-11 for ballet flats and they fit fine in my size 11 Tieks. Wore all day with no rubbing or sock showing. ",2
2,4,I love my gekks! My feet sweat a lot so these help keep my feet from sliding around. I recommend them to everyone now - they are worth the price. ,2
2,5,"Comfortable and perfect
",2
2,5,Perfect fit!,2
2,5,"Awesome product.  These ""socks"" made a new shoe purchase absolutely perfect.  They actually made the shoe more comfortable to wear!  I will definitely buy more.",2
2,5,"I can finally comfortably wear my flats without ugly socks showing!
",2
2,4,The product itself is great! No more fixing my little socks that have slipped down during the day. Was a little disappointed in the slow shipping though.  ,2
2,5,I was skeptical at first because they seemed morencopicatsd at first. But once I sat down and put them in my shoes they fit perfectly and went in quite easily. Comfortable to weak. May buy some more ,2
2,5,This is a miracle product! ,2
2,5,They work better than expected.,2
2,4,"LOVE the product!!!! The shipping took longer than expected and industry standard, but I'll definitely order more!",2
2,4,"I had my doubts on how these would actually stay in my shoes, but they have done quite well. And fairly easy to install! ",2
2,5,"I bought these in beige and they are so much better than the original ones.  The toe box is square and they seem to fit the shoe better, and are easier to slip into.",2
2,5,Easy to install and use.  Love the NO-SHOW!!,2
2,5,Love them!  Perfect solution for keeping my shoes from smelling like death!  As an added bonus I am not trying to hide shoe liners all day!,2
2,4,So far I have only worn them one time but they worked great in a pair of ballet flats. I couldn't give them 5 stars merely for lack of mor experience with them. ,2
2,4,Just trying them today...hope they stay in place...so far..very nice!,2
2,5,Easy to install in shoes and very comfortable.  Stay in place perfectly just like the advertisement stated!,2
2,5,"Wonderful!  I know I have gekks in my shoes, but no one else can tell!",2
2,5,Great product,2
2,5,"Feel great comfortable,,would buy again",2
2,5,So glad something like this exists. I had been wearing my Tieks sockless for awhile and they were definitely starting to smell. I tried using foot powder and it really didn't help. Now I feel like my shoes are going to last much longer!,2
2,5,love them,2
2,5,They work so well and feel great! Keeps my feet dry and odor free!,2
2,5,I love my new gekks!,2
2,4,They really don't show and are very comfortable,2
2,5,Fantastic product. Wish I had found these even sooner!!!,2
2,4,"The adhesive portion of the Gekks fit perfectly into my flats and adhered well to the shoe. The liner is simple to attach and doesn't affect the way the shoe feels when you wear it with non-Gekk socks.

But then it came time to attach the Gekk sock to the liner, and I wondered if it was the wrong size. I had to stretch the socks to their limit to get them to fit the shoe. When I wore them, the toe cover on the sock hits my toes at a funny place because of how small or low they are. This might be a design choice to allow people to wear extremely low cut flats, but it made them much less comfortable than they could have been. Also, whereas the liner was perfectly smooth and comfortable to walk on, the sock had a strange ribbed texture that felt rough on my feet. 

Nevertheless, the Gekks did accomplish what they promised: I was able to wear flats all day without socks. I loved being able to slip my feet in and out of the shoe without ugly no-show socks showing, and the overall concept was excellent. It definitely makes my ballet flats more appealing to wear. But I think the sock design could use some work.",2
2,4,"The best ""no-show"" sock I've ever had --- and I've tried a lot! ",2
2,4,"The best ""no-show"" sock I've ever had --- and I've tried a lot! ",2
2,4,I like the gekks themselves. I wish the grippers were black to match the gekks though. They peek out sometimes and since they're bright white - it looks tacky. They definitely help my everyday work flats. I'm only rating these 4 stars though because the customer service and order process is awful. It took over 2 weeks for them to actually ship my order - with no notice that it would take that long. I had to email several times to get an update on their status.,2
2,5,The heel stays in place and the toe doesn't slide around.  Very comfortable.,2
2,5,I got these because I have so many flats. They were easy to insert and made my feet feel less hot and sweaty than going barefoot,2
2,4,Really comfortable and easy to insert. Just need to get used to sliding my feet into the shoes so that the inserts fit around my toes properly instead of just shoving my feet in there like I used to.,2
2,4,"more difficult to install than expected; the instruction sheet enclosed showed an anchor piece for toes as well as heel and sole, and nothing was included (although on the online video one is not shown either).  Not having the toe piece anchored makes it a bit wonky to get them on straight so something isn't rubbing a toe or bunching under the foot...perhaps its a learning curve?  Will wear them a few more times to try to get used to them and see if they do hold up as well as promised.
",2
2,5,They're great!,2
2,4,I like the idea of this product. It does take a bit of doing to install them but once done they work fine. A very cool idea actually!,2
2,5,"I luv my tieks, but your liners are too thick for them!!!!",2
2,4,They're pretty nice,2
2,5,love them,2
2,5,Clever and unique product!,2
2,5,I think this is a great idea!,2
2,5,"I love them and want more! I've told all my friends about them. I need to save some money to get more! Wore some of the old, yucky kind of flat sock this week and they lasted all of 30 minutes before they were off my feet and in the trash. NOT even worth the money. Thank you Gekks! ",2
2,4,"Delivery was a bit slow.  As for the Gekks themselves, pretty good so far!  They're thin enough that they don't make your shoes tight.",2
2,5,They're great!,2
2,5,"These are absolutely amazing. They stayed in place, were comfortable, and kept my feet dry and cool. Love love love it and will definitely be getting more for my other flats and heels! Omg now I can wear heels!!! üò± Didn't think about that yay!",2
2,5,GAME CHANGER - these are SO Awesome.  I'm kicking myself that i even hesitated ordering Gekks.  They keep your feed cool and comfy and i'm forever rid of those ridiculous peds that always slipped off and showed.  ,2
2,4,"I have severe hyperhidrosis, therefore my feet sweat, I ruin shoes and it can be hard to wear ballet flats and certain types of shoes so when I found out about gekks I was excited - here's something that can almost double as a sock and be washed in the machine.  I'm pretty pleased with the product overall. ",2
2,5,Love the ballet flats.  No more slipping off my heel.  ,2
2,5,Love my gekks!,2
2,4,"These make my flats feel comfy and it's nice not to worry about no-show socks peeking out.  It is a little tricky to slip on and get your toes properly placed, and they easily catch if you have a sharp toenail.  Shipment took nearly a month.",2
2,4,"I love these things! As long as you can follow directions to put them in your shoe, they stay in place, are not visible and do their job (which for me that meant helping my feet stay dry and comfortable in hot Texas weather). I will be ordering more for future shoes!",2
2,5,I love them!  I wear flats all summer... They do what they claim to do... I love how easy they are to put in and change between shoes!  ,2
2,4,Love these!,2
2,5,LOVE the ballet flats.....perfect no see solution for shoes.,2
2,5,So easy and they don't slip! World of difference!,2
2,5,Awesome socks!,2
2,4,"Good, definitely fit my Tieks well, easy to apply, and I like the no smell effect ",2
2,4,I like them very much and will probably order another pair.  Sometimes it is a little tricky to get my toes into the socks in just the right place.,2
2,5,Love them.  I didn't think anything like this would work.  Won't go without them.,2
2,5,Perfect....work like a dream.,2
2,5,"Fantastic, easy-to-use, and smart!",2
2,5,I have put them in the shoes & the installation was easy enough & they seem to fit well but I haven't actually worn them yet as I'm still wearing mostly sandals. Will let you know!,2
2,5,"I have been looking for a solution for a pair of shoes that I could not wear toe (mule) socks with ... I generally resorted to powder which leaked out onto the shoe and all over my feet .... I was so thrilled to find Gekks - the grippers were a little challenging to install, but in the end I am a big fan!",2
2,5,"These are what I've been searching for all of these years! With all of the fashionable shoes out there, I wondered why it took so long to find a sock that worked with them. Gekks has filled that void and I am a convert!",2
2,5,Finally no-shows that don't slip off my feet in 10 seconds of wearing them!,2
2,5,Loved them! Super comfortable!,2
2,5,Very comfy and easy to use.,2
2,5,"The inserts themselves are great. It would be really nice though if Gekks offered custom closet packs. All of your deals are for closet packs, but the pack doesn't include the combination of inserts I need.",2
2,4,A little tricky to install,2
2,4,"They were very easy to put in the shoe. I only walked around inside., But I hardly felt them (that's a good think).  Glad there is a way to wash them.",2
2,4,"I had wore them with 3 diff pairs of flats, they were easy to install and stay on even without the grippers. I got the medium based on shoes size, but the front seems to not cover all my toes at first and at times (I have wide feet), and need to adjust them occasionally. ",2
2,5,Love them! They work great in my ballet flats. I do not have to worry about reaching down and fixing them like other brands that work off your heel. Need them for pumps now!!!,2
2,5,I love them!,2
2,5,Love Gekks! Want them for every pair of my shoes!,2
2,5,They are great,2
2,5,Love them! ,2
2,5,Fit my flats perfectly and they don't compromise the size.  My shoes fit perfectly and are more comfortable with Gekks. Also with it being the heat of the summer my shoes stay fresh and odor free even after a full day of non stop wear at work. ,2
2,5,So far so good. Have been using them a few days in my shoes and they are super comfortable! No more sweaty feeling feet! ,2
2,5,Great solution! Very comfortable!,2
2,5,They are awesome,2
2,5,"These socks are amazing!! I love that they don't move at all. My feet were a little smelly after a full day at the salon, but not near as much as they would have been sans socks. Super excited to put these in all my flats!",2
2,4,"Comfy and cute.  Not used to such a flat shoe ... but going to be!
",2
2,5,I was so happy to find these as a gift to my daughter & she loves them!,2
2,4,"So far they work well. Sometimes they become uncomfortable in the area that surrounds my toes because it bunches up. They do stay secure. I use them in my Rothy's and did not need to use the adhesive. Rather, they attach well without it to the insoles. I will see how they hold up when I wash them.",2
2,5,work as well as I hoped they would. Glad I bought them.,2
2,5,Love that I can slip on and go without worrying about slippery shoe liners.,2
2,5,The fit all of my flats well. ,2
2,5,Love these! I can pull them out and wash them and now my shoes no longer stink!,2
2,5,These are the best things ever. They make such a difference in the summer.  Telling all of my friends. ,2
2,5,"Where have these been all my life.
",2
2,5,These ballet flats are outstanding !  I have had so many people ask me about them. I gave a pair to my daughter for Mother's Day and she is now a big fan.,2
2,5,"They work great.  Way better than the no show socks that never stay up!
",2
2,5,I love them!  What a great idea. I need more,2
2,5,The shoes were shipped quickly and in a cute gift package.  They are very well made and don't even attempt to fall off.   I am on my feet all day and there is plenty of cushion. I really love these shoes. ,2
2,5,"Wearing my gekks with my new Rothys on 100+ degree day and feet feel great, not sweaty at all!",2
2,5,"Bought a pair to try, and love them.",2
2,5,Great product!!!,2
2,5,So far the Gekks seem to be working very nicely. I've worn the flats I put them in twice. They gekks stayed in place and were comfortable. Haven't installed the second pair yet. Happy with this purchase. ,2
2,4,I  wish they came in a 3 pack too. I am still having redness of my left heel but no open sores like I usually get after a few hours. So far I'm very pleased. ,2

2,5,"Awesome !!! Love, love, love them... perfect for my shoes that were just a tad too big.. these fixed that issue...",2
2,5,They work perfectly with my Tieks and really do help with the smell. ,2
2,5,they worked great as described. They are just too expensive to put in all my shoes.,2
2,5,Shipping took a bit longer than expected but the inserts were worth the wait! The light cushioning made my flats more comfortable and the breathable material prevented moisture build up. Very satisfied and will definitely order more! ,2
2,5,I suffer from sweaty feet . Yuck . So I was surprised they actual kept my feet dry and stayed put! Amazing ! Thanks Gekks ! ,2
2,4,Good,2
2,4,"It took a bit to get the Gekks into my shoes, but they fit well and seem to work well. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. ",2
2,4,The geeks were easy to insert into the ballet flat type of shoe. The shoes felt comfortable however I gave a four star rating because due to the time of year I haven‚Äôt been wearing the shoes. I do feel positive that I will be very pleased with the geeks when warm weather returns and I can wear the shoes barefoot. If they work well I will order more.,2
2,4,"I like Gekks because my feet still fit in my shoes after adding them. I wish that there was an adhesive on the top of the sock, so it would be easier to stick my foot into my shoe in a hurry. Sometimes the sock gets bunched up.",2
2,5,NICE!,2
2,5,they are surprisingly suitable,2
2,5,"I was skeptical that they would actually work, but after installing in my Born ballet flats I absolutely love them! They don‚Äôt move around at all, and they stay put all day. Super impressed and will probably be getting more for my other shoes. Not sure why they‚Äôve been getting so many negative reviews online? If you install them correctly, they work great! ",2
2,5,love them,2
2,4,Hard to get in shoes and one of the pieces that pull off didn't come off.  They are comfortable after wearing a few times.,2
2,5,Perfect ,2
2,5,Perfect ,2
2,4,"Comfy! I wish the heel portion had rounded edges or was wider. It gets caught on my heel as I'm slipping shoes on. Otherwise, I love! Purchased more.",2
2,5,Feels almost like I'm wearing socks--nice and cozy.,2
2,5,Nice addition to my tieks,2
2,5,I‚Äôll be buying more!,2
2,5,Love! Everything I hoped for.,2
2,5,Wonderful!  Made walking all day at Disneyland painless!  ,2
2,5,Love it!,2
2,5,Comfortable.,2
2,5,"love these, my ballet flats now don't give me blisters!!",2
2,4,"They feel nice. I wish they were easy to remove and transfer
to different shoes ",2
2,5,perfect!!!,2
2,4,"These have finally solved the problem of going sockless with flats.  So far, I‚Äôm thrilled with them, but waiting to see how well they wash up and whether or not they will be easy to reinsert into the shoe and stay. ",2
2,5,Love them! They are so versatile. I can wear them with jeans or with a dress and they are perfect. ,2
2,5,These are freaking amazing!!,2
2,5,Love them. Just ordered two more. ,2
2,5,nice,2
2,5,"Easy to put into the shoes and worked exactly as 
i had hoped.",2
2,5,"I love these socks - they stay in place and keep my shoes from smelling terribly. What I don't love is that my order took a month between when my credit card was charged and when they arrived and I've gotten zero interaction with their customer service throughout the entire time I was waiting for them. I still haven't gotten any follow-up about why my order was delayed so much - not even a ""sorry this happened, we'll do better next time."" But, I do get daily emails about ordering more!",2
2,5,Easy to wash. Very comfortable ,2
2,4,Make such a difference!,2
2,5,Can‚Äôt imagine not having them,2
2,5,I absolutely love this concept and my two new pairs of Gekks!  I would definitely recommend them to anyone that wears flats and doesn't like socks or those little no-shows that never stay put!  I will be purchasing a couple more pairs for sure!,2
2,5,"These are fabulous!  They really do stay in place, they're comfortable, and they made my favorite pair of flats stop sliding on my heels.  And so far they seem to have kept the stench at bay - which is a miracle, since I'm know for stinky feet.

2,5,"I have one pair of shoes in particular that are too tight to wear with regular socks, but feel great using Gekks!",2

2,5,"Love them, they fit perfectly and are simple to install",2
2,4,They are working well.,2
2,5,Very pleased. As advertised can t wait for summer to get far more use.,2
2,4,They work so much better than the poor excuses for socks I've been making do with. They're comfy and they stay put. Installing them was kind of a pain. ,2
2,5,Great no shows and doesn't slip.,2
2,5,Perfect solution for my Tieks! It's so hard to find a non slip solution and the odor block is priceless!,2
2,5,Great for my low cut ballet flats.,2
2,5,"These work even better than I thought they would!
",2
2,4,"As a self proclaimed foot nudist, I will have to say I'm impressed with how well these liners have worked so far.  I never want to wear socks again, and this just may be my solution.  I would have given five stars, but I had a little trouble with the grippers adhering to my first pair of shoes.  However, even with having gripper troubles, the liners have been working pretty well.  The grippers I put in my second pair of shoes have stuck pretty well making the liners better.  I will be buying more Gekks!",2
2,4,Easier to install than the slip ons. No stinkiness in my tieka so far,2
2,4,"Love the concept and may buy more, however, I feel the adhesive should be stronger. ",2
2,4,I like that my foot does not slip when walking.,2
2,5,Love the !',2
2,5,Very happy with my new liners. ,2
2,4,"Fairly simple installation, don't show unlike regular ped socks, comfortable, and will help prevent odor issues - individual heel gripper could stand to be more curved in shape ",2
2,5,Love these in my flats!,2
2,5,Simplifies my mornings. Gekks eliminate a lot of wasted time and energy worrying about what combination of socks/tights/shoes go with a particular outfit in a particular kind of weather.,2
2,5,"I just got my pair for my new flats, and I love these socks!! Really easy to put in and instantly made my feet feel more comfortable. I will definitely be buying another pair for some loafers and some for my husband, too!",2
2,5,Super easy to install and I can't tell the difference between gekks and the liners I usually use for my flats.  Definitely would consider getting more.,2
2,5,"Love my Gekks, I have the closet pack as well as the ballets. Perfect for summer and my shoes last longer.",2
2,5,Great!,2
2,5,easy to use,2
2,5,I love these shoes!,2
2,4,"I wish they were a little silkier...smoother on the foot....instead of the ribbing design.  I did not find the directions for attachment to be the easiest, but I did finally get them attached! I am glad I found something to line my Tieks with as the leather on the inside was kind of rough. I would give them a grade of B-.",2
2,5,I accidentally ordered my pair a size smaller than what I wanted.  I tried them out anyway and they were fine.  I usually wear a 9 and ordered the 7-8 range.  The first time I wore them I was impressed.  My feet were dry and comfortable all day.  Same thing the next time I wore them.  I am happy with the product so far.,2
2,5,"So soft, and the perfect color! I've worn them many times now! however after the first time wearing them, I scuffed them and as a result some of the leather came off of the toe part. I usually wear a US 7.5 and the 8 fit a little big but better than too small.",2
2,5,Amazing I am in love!,2
2,4,Best of the no show socks that I've tried. My toes came out of the front but nothing that can't be managed. The no odor material was a little disappointing. But overall worth it to try. ,2
2,5,Love these!,2
2,5,"Such a great concept and for me, they work better than the sneaker or loafer gekks.",2
2,4,"They work really well - my only criticism is that they're a bit difficult to install.  Not impossible, but leaving the sock attached to the gripper for installation was much easier.  Other than that, the sock works well with my Tieks!  Will purchase more in the future.",2
2,5,"They were pretty easy to put into my flats and seem to be working well, especially late into the day after I've been wearing my shoes all day. I can tell that's when my feet get sweaty and normally start slipping around and with the Gekks, no slipping or odors so far!",2
2,5,Perfect for my Tieks!,2
2,5,"I've worn them a couple of times and so far so good.  They stayed put and I love that they are ""NO SHOW""!!",2
2,5,Love my first pair of Gekks! They were easy to install and felt great in my new Tieks! Will definitely be getting more for my sneakers and other shoes. They feel soft and comfy without feeling sweaty! Great product! ,2
2,5,Genius! Love the liners for my Tieks! ,2
2,5,Great so far!,2
2,4,Not too bad!  Wish the toe part of the sock was a little bigger,2
2,4,Very comfy! Works just like advertised!,2
2,5,These are fantastic!  I love them and are thinking about buying the sneakers style.,2
2,5,Loved them!!  Will be getting more!,2
2,5,The gekks were easy to install and the large fit well on my size 10 wide foot. I have been using them for a few months and no smell!,2
2,4,"I like the way that they wear and they do keep my feet from stinking, but the adhesive on the grippers could be stronger. I've only used them a couple of times and the grippers are starting to loosen from the heel. ",2
2,5,Exactly as advertised... love them!,2
2,5,I honestly didn't know what to expect.  I slipped these into my Tieks and was off.  So happy with the purchase.,2
2,5,They are awesome! ,2
2,4,"I like the product and love how it doesn't show anywhere like other low profile socks do, but I was sent the wrong colors that I ordered. Super frustrating but thankfully customer service support was great and helped me out! ",2
2,5,"So far, so good!  I've only had them a week but they seem to really do the job.  No scrunching up in my shoes.  I'm going to order a few more pairs. ",2
2,5,I need more! ,2
2,4,"I really like the ballet flats. Only problem is getting them on quickly; I have to reach down and maneuver the material so my toes will go on in correctly (material gets bunched up when you take them off). Once in, extremely comfortable all day. Easy to install in my shoe, except for heel section- that was a bit tricky at first, but after the second one I found the path of least resistance for me and it worked. The directions for the heel could be better. I've bought the other styles for all my shoes now. ",2
2,5,"These liners are awesome!! I have two pairs of the extremely expensive, extremely comfortable ballet flats that shall remain nameless. One pair are absolutely wonderful and I wear them all the time. The other pair, handpainted, and almost twice the price of the first pair, never were as comfortable as the first pair. Enter Gekks. I originally ordered them, to have a liner in the shoes, to prevent excess wear and odor. However, they also made the second pair more comfortable!!! Yeah! (Now, I don't feel like I've wasted $345!!! I bought my daughter two pair, as well, and she loves them, too! I'm going to get the ones for sneakers next!
",2
2,5,"Seriously, I'm never looking back to those little sock/footie things I was wearing before. These Gekks are amazing, and I'm in love. 
",2
2,4,So far so good.  Feels a little odd at first but I'm sure I'll get used to it,2
2,5,"It was a real surprise that it worked so well. I had some shoes that were a little loose. This solved my problem with a stay in place ""sock"".  Thanks Gekks!",2
2,5,"how did I live without these!
",2
2,5,These are great! I have them in my shoes I wear to work every day. It saves me a step of putting on no show socks that still peeked out and I don't spend all day pulling socks up. Love it! ,2
2,5,"Easy to ""install"" into my shoes. Wish each pair came with more bases. ",2
2,5,Fantastic! Definitely ordering more!,2
2,4,I was skeptical but put them in my new flats. Perfection! Love the way they fell against my skin!,2
2,5,I was skeptical but put them in my new flats. Perfection! Love the way they fell against my skin!,2

2,4,I was skeptical but put them in my new flats. Perfection! Love the way they fell against my skin!,2
2,5,"Super easy to use, makes my flats so much more comfortable and no more sweaty feet!",2
2,5,"I was a little skeptical at first.  Did not think they would stay in my shoe.  I wore them on a trip last weekend in my favorite flats and did not want to take off my shoes all weekend!  Very comfortable and once inserted, they don't budge.  I am ordering a few more pairs...",2
2,5,Awesome! Easy to install and works like a charm! ,2
2,5,Love it ,2
2,5,Love them!  ,2
2,5,Fit great in my shoes and are comfortable. ,2
2,4,"They function well and are as described, but because the largest size is 9+, they seem a little short for my sized 10.5/11 feet. The seam falls directly on top of my toes and is a little uncomfortable. ",2
2,5,"Instructions were a little more complex and wordy than they needed to be, but once in, these worked great to help keep dress shoes for work in better condition",2
2,5,I love it ,2
2,5,I think they are fantastic! What a great idea! ,2
2,5,Beyond my expectations!?! ,2
2,4,Practical and comfortable to use. A little tricky to initially install.,2
2,5,"The started to unravel üòï
I thought they would be thicker with more cushioning ",2
2,5,Absolutely pleased with the shoes and with the service. thanks for ,2
2,5,"I love my Gekks!  They do exactly what they're advertised to do.  They minimize odor, which I think also makes the shoes last longer.   They were easy to install, and I'll definitely be back for more!",2
2,4,"The instructions were a little confusing and it took nearly two weeks after my order to receive them, but so far they do what they are supposed to do. No smelly ballet flats!",2
2,5,These were easy to install and I love the comfort they bring to my once uncomfortable work flats!,2
2,5,Love them!  Perfect for slip on shoes! ,2
2,5,Thank you!  Finally liners that don't slip off and bunch up!  Must have for people who have problems with their heels!,2
2,4,Very Comfortable. But no structure to the shoe. It will show any bunion or irregularities. But still love. ,2
2,5,They're comfortable and made the inside of my shoes look new.,2
2,5,Perfect for my tieks. ,2
2,5,Perfect for my tieks. ,2
2,5,Great fitting in my new Tiek's ballet flats! Sizes accurate and very comfortable. Impressive new product.,2
2,4,"They are good, my pinky toe keeps popping out but other than that they are great!!",2
2,5,"I ordered the flats, what I receive was an insert for the shoe . Please call 305-510-2606",2
2,5,"Love them so cute and comfortable, will be coming back for more colors ",2
2,5,great! Now I want Gekks for my high heels and wedges!! ,2
2,4,"The leather is soft and the support is good, but the elastic is rough and hurts my feet.",2
2,4,"Only a little tricky to place in the shoe. I got them for my tieks and the natural fold made it so. Have had them a few days so far and pretty happy. I can tell they are there and have to make sure my toes fit in just right to keep the top over my toes. You cannot see them which I like. I do not know if they will help will smell yet, but we shall see what the future brings.",2
2,5,"Great shoes. Walked all over Seattle in this ballet flats. 
",2
2,5,"They feel just as comfortable as the little socks you wear, but work SO MUCH BETTER! All shoes should have these in them!",2
2,5,PERFECT with Tieks! ,2
2,5,I love these shoes. Someone told me years ago I would love them and this is my third pair so far. Super comfy and not like other flats that take a while to break in if you have a wider foot. Thanks Tieks! ,2
2,5,"These are my favorite!  They are so sleek, they don't change the way my shoes fit and they are completely invisible. I wish you could get more of the part that sticks in your shoes so you could just swap out the other piece. I have several ballet flats and I will be getting these for every pair!",2
2,5,They're fantastic so far. I don't have to worry about my socks showing or having foot odor.,2
2,5,Love the Gekks for Ballet Flats!,2
2,5,These have been great! the keep my feet from rubbing and so far have kept that sockless shoe stench from stinking up my shoes. ,2
2,5,Perfect for Ballet Flats. Added comfort.,2
2,4,fits well,2
2,5,Fantastic!!,2
2,5,Just the best,2
2,4,"LOVE the concept! I wear a size 12 women's and purchased the Large size for 9+ (after confirming with customer service this should still work for me). Overall, they work pretty well. I do wish there was a slightly larger option though - sometimes at the end of the day my toes feel a little squished but I'm much happier using these than going without! :)",2
2,5,"Comfy, easy to install, no smell!",2
2,5,"These are amazing! So perfect with ballet flats, I don't have to worry about my socks sliding off or the edges showing above where the shoe is anymore.  Love them! ",2
2,5,"Before purchasing this product, I wasn't sure if this product would work with pointy-toed heel pumps as well, but they work fabulously with those types of shoes as well! Will definitely purchase more!",2
2,5,"Love them!  Finally found ""socks"" that don't show in my flats.",2
2,5,LOVE them!!!  Very comfy and do exactly what they say they will!,2
2,5,"This was not my first pair of Gekks, and it won't be my last! I had a great pair of flats that started to smell. Ew. I threw them out and bought a new pair, put in Gekks and a year later, they still don't smell. Gekks work!",2
2,5,"How did I ever live without them?  They are perfect with my Tieks!  Comfortable, a little tricky to apply at first, but easy as you get the hang of it.  Wonderful product.",2
2,5,Love them...doesn't feel like i'm going sockless!  ,2
2,5,Stays in shoe and doesn't slip off my feet ,2
2,5,Love them!!!!!!,2
2,4,Just wish I didn't have to buy a pair for every shoe,2
2,5,Love them!,2
2,5,These are awesome!,2
2,5,Finally I found something that works to keep my sweaty feet from rubbing against my shoes. They are hidden so no one knows they're there. And I no longer have to put powder in my shoes before I begin my day. I will order more!,2
2,4,Good idea,2
2,5,Bought the ballet style in the nude color and they are invisible in my white lacy shors. Perfect!,2
2,5,I was super excited to see them in my mailbox!  I fittedone pair into a new pair of shoes right away. The instructions were simple and they fit easily. Very comfortable and true to size! ,2
2,5,Great!,2
2,4,Extra sicky bases wouldve been nice,2
2,4,"After I once figured out how to insert them, I loved them. ",2
2,4,"After I once figured out how to insert them, I loved them. ",2
2,4,They're sort of difficult to insert but nice once they're in the shoe,2
2,5,Love my Gekks!! I'm always skeptical of a new product!!!! Especially when ordered online without the ability to view it first! I can say with all confidence that everything advertised is true! I plan to order many more pairs!,2
2,5,Love my Gekks!! I'm always skeptical of a new product!!!! Especially when ordered online without the ability to view it first! I can say with all confidence that everything advertised is true! I plan to order many more pairs!,2
2,5,Went into my shoes easily... easy to slip my feet in and out... very comfortable. ,2
2,5,These Gekks are great! Easy to place in your shoe and stay in place. Very comfortable. I highly recommend them.,2
2,5,Wonderful ,2
2,5,"I LOVE MY BALLET FLATS!! Gekks allow me to wear my Tieks with that much more confidence!  I'll be purchasing some to wear with my All-Stars.  
",2
2,5,Awesome awesome awesome!!! Where has this product been all my life! Love it!! ,2
2,5,these are AMAZING in my Tieks! I cant wait to get some for all my converse and toms/bobs!,2
2,5,These are the perfect solution to stinky work shoes and feet. I'm in love!! ,2
2,5,These are the perfect solution to stinky work shoes and feet. I'm in love!! ,2
2,4,The worked really well.,2
2,5,Love my new Gekk's! They fit perfectly in my Tieks ballet flats!,2
2,4,"Nice quality improvements made since I purchased my first pair of Gekks. The stitching on the insert should hopefully keep the ""sticky"" part attached. My last pair fell apart after washing because the adhesive gave way. Hopefully these last longer and withstand normal washing in accordance with the care instructions.",2
2,5,finally a pair of socks that don't show over my ballet slippers,2
2,5,"These were the best of all of the inserts. I don't like when my socks show in my ballet slippers, so these are great!!!",2
2,4,"These installed easily, and so far I like them. Just ordered the closet pack. Should have reviewed first, then placed my order. Duh. ",2
2,4,"I think they are really good, my question is can you move them from shoe to shoe or do you need one pair for each pair of shoes?",2
2,5,4th pair! ,2
2,5,Love them,2
2,4,They are okay. They stay a little better than socks. ,2
2,5,They were for my grandchild and she's happy with them.,2
2,5,I love the ballet flat gekks!  No more stinky sockless feet and they stay in place nicely,2
2,5,They were better than expected! Stayed in place. Fit perfectly. Will definitely purchase more. ,2
2,5,Great product! ,2
2,5,Works well ,2
2,5,I love them! This is the only item I've found that truly works.,2
2,4,Love everything except where it goes over your toes - that part wasn't wide enough to cover all my toes.,2
2,5,"Fast and easy installation, simple directions to cut down for sizing. Very convenient to slip shoes on and go. No smell after walking around Washington DC al day in them!",2
2,5,"I love my ballet flats, they are exactly what I've needed for my flat shoes!",2
2,4,"I followed the directions to the letter, but it seems that the front part is slipping a little. I will give it a little more time and try my others in another shoe to see if the issue resolves. Otherwise, I like the product. ",2
2,5,Works better than I thought! Very comfortable. ,2
2,4,Very comfortable ,2
2,4,"They are great! Easy to install, easy to wear!",2
2,4,I like the flats. They are so comfy and i have a hard time finding a flat i can wear due to pain across the widest part of my foot.  I first bought the black matt in my regular size 8 but it was too tight.  I exchanged for the next higher size 9 and it fits like a glove with no break in required.  I only gave 4 stars because i don't like the way the heel looks a little boxy.  But i will buy more and am deciding on my next color..,2
2,5,Love them. Really helped with odor. I plan to buy more for all my shoes. ,2
2,4,"These work great. The only downside is that once you take your foot out, you can't just slip it back in. The toe part of the sock turns inside out and you have to flip it before you can put your shoes back on. Other than that I love these things!",2
2,4,"These work great. The only downside is that once you take your foot out, you can't just slip it back in. The toe part of the sock turns inside out and you have to flip it before you can put your shoes back on. Other than that I love these things!",2
2,5,The ballet flat Gekks work perfectly with my Tieks!  I plan to order several more for my other flats!,2
2,5,Well designed and comfortable. ,2
2,5,Gekks are my new favs!  Recommending them to everyone!,2
2,5,Love these! Perfect for all of my ballet flats. ,2
2,4,"Once I figured out how to properly install them, they were fantastic!  ",2
2,5,"I was skeptical at first, the design threw me when I opened the package. I had imagined that they were a formed insert. But I understand the idea behind the velcro and sticky-backs. I walk alot at my job and when I first put them on I could ""feel"" the toe area and I thought it would drive me nuts... but after a few minutes I didn't even notice them. The anti-odor really works too! I was in those shoes for about 12 hours and there was no smell at all. Pretty amazing. I bought the ballet flats version, which I put in my Toms. Probably should have bought the ""loafers"" version, but this worked great too. No complains here. Happy customer.",2
2,5,Very comfortable!,2
2,5,"Really love my Gekks and will be ordering more. They work as stated to prevent odor. Really easy to put install in shoes, too. ",2
2,5,Love these! They fit in the shoes well and are not too bulky. They also do not press on the tops of my feet with tight elastic like other brands do!,2
2,5,Worked great for my closed toe sandels. I ordered additional grippers ,2
2,5,"Finally, a way to keep my ballet flats from getting smelly!",2
2,5,I am so glad I got these. I have them in a pair of my work heels. They fit perfectly and don't move around. The best part is that you can't see them at all. ,2
2,5,Very comfortable. Love them,2
2,4,Love them!!! Best Thing Ever,2
2,5,"Love it, my third pair! ",2
2,5,Love em!  Now want more!,2
2,5,"I love my ballet flats Gekks but I am concerned about the back gripper situation between the black and  the nude pair I ordered. They seem to be made differently and I've noticed the two wear differently as well. Please see my other review regarding the extra gripper set, which outlines the issue I experienced. ",2
2,4,Great! Love that the Gekks don't show but I still have the comfort of something between my feet and the shoes. My shoes are a tad more snug than I'd prefer with the added cushion of the grippers but I will just purchase a half size up next time I buy flats. ,2
2,5,I absolutely love Gekks! No more searching for matches to my small socks and no more trying to hide them on my shoes! ,2
2,5,"These are GREAT! I've been looking for a solution for my Tieks flats specifically so when I saw these on Instagram on an actual pair of Tieks, I figured I'd try them out! They did not disappoint! One of my favorite features is how you can buy extra grippers at a low cost so it's easy to switch the Gekks themselves back and forth between different pairs of shoes. A great deal and comfortable to wear! Once you get the hang of getting your toes in the liner, these are barely even noticeable!",2
2,5,Love them!,2
2,5,Easy to install and comfortable.,2
2,4,"Please watch the video before cutting the grippers and inserting the Gekks.  The video makes the process so easy to understand. I have the Gekks in four new pair of ballet flats and haven't had one blister, which is very unusual for me. I gave them 4 stars only because the written instructions are a bit confusing.",2
2,5,A game changer!  I always got sweaty feet from wearing ballet flats.  Not anymore.  Wonderful product.  Be sure to purchase gripper sets to use them in multiple pairs!,2
2,5,"I absolutely love love love my Ballet Flats from GEKKS! I have non peripheral neuropathy in both feet and have been wearing backless shoes for forever until my podiatrist told me I needed to start wearing shoes with backs. So, I bought 6 pair of dress flats for work and 2 pair of sneakers for casual. However, all of the rubbed my heels raw.  I tried wearing huge band aids on my heels but they slipped out of place and of course didn't help. One day while cruising the web I saw an advertisements for GEKKS and said what could this be. After reading the website I placed my order and couldn't wait for them to come. I ordered 4 pair with two extra heel pads and I have put them in four pair of my shoes.  I cannot believe the difference! I can wear the shoes with no slipping, rubbing or blisters and my neuropathy even seem to be better! I have ordered more for my other shoes and I will forever remain a GEKKS customer! Thank you for giving me an option for my feet that really works!",2
2,5,They work great,2
2,5,This is my second pair. I'm very satisfied with these inserts. I've been able to successfully use them for smoking slippers as well (not just ballet flats). I'm a size 7. Hope that's helpful!,2
2,5,I love my Geeks,2
2,5,Perfect for my Taos shoes! ,2
2,5,Easy to install and very comfortable.,2
2,4,Love them!,2
2,4,The instructions to put them in the shoes was really good.  With the spring and summer coming I'll really be putting these to the test.  Looking forward to it.  Great product!  Thanks!,2
2,5,Love these....they're great!  First thing I've found that doesn't show...will order more.,2
2,5,These are great!  ,2
2,5,The only ballet socks that stay on your feet.  My second pair.,2
2,5,Love them! Ordering more soon!!,2
2,5,Perfect!,2
2,4,I'm really excited about this product! Thank you!,2
2,5,Easy to use and don't slip at all. ,2
2,5,"Once I got them in place, they are awesome. They are so comfortable--I do want to get several more pairs for my flats and sneakers. A definite recommendation!",2
2,4,"I've never worn flats without hosiery before because I find it too uncomfortable to wear flats barefoot. Also, I haven't been able to find a pair for flat socks that wasn't either too tight, would slide around, or could see the sock peeking out around the flats. Gekks are comfortable, stay in place, and were odorless. My reasons for rating them 4 stars instead of 5 were: I didn't realize I couldn't switch the 1 pair around different pairs of flats. Once that adhesive base layer is applied to the inside of the shoe, you can't take it out and put it in different shoe. Also, I wish there was some way to make the left and right sides of the foot more comfortable (compared to the toe and heel)",2
2,4,"So far, so good. I have heard stories of the adhesive tearing the soles when removing, I'm hoping that's not the case. They feel great and no stinky feet!",2
2,5,"So far, so good! I've been wearing my Gekks ballet flats in two pairs of shoes for a couple weeks now (both flats with pointy toes) and they are comfortable and -- BONUS -- keep my feet warmer than just wearing flats alone. I only rotate between two pairs of ballet flats at a time (usually ones I can't wear socks with) so they get worn out quickly and (full disclosure) stinky quickly. After two weeks no stink... not sure if it's too early to tell but have been happy so far!",2
2,5,"They work out nicely - I wish the toe caps were a little wider, I can't seem to get my Gekks placed in quite the right way for my wide  feet so my pinkie toes don't feel covered all the time. But they do their job otherwise and were easy to install so I like them!",2
2,4,These are great for controlling the smell. The only problem is they stick too well if you don't remove them for a while and then the interlocking part stays put while the adhesive tears from the sock and then it is essentially time to throw them away. ,2
2,5,They fit so well in my ballet flats! I have already purchased more grippers and a pair for my slip on Skechers!,2
2,4," I was so intrigued when I saw them advertised‚Ä¶ I waited for them for quite a while, LOL they took about a month to arrive I guess they were backordered because of the popularity. They take a little while to install ‚Ä¶ I bought two part/grips and one pair of liners for ballet flats. In use them with my Tieks..The silver thread that is woven into them must have amazing antimicrobial properties!   My only issue with him is that one of my pair of Tieks ballet flats now feels like it is too small at the toe!   This must just be due to the thickness of the sock/liner‚Ä¶  so this could be an issue for other customers, ",2
2,4,These worked pretty well. They did crumple up a bit in the heal. Maybe the sticky wasn't adhered good enough before wearing. I was surprised that I couldn't move them from shoes to shoes. They seem kind of pricey for a one pair use. ,2
2,5,I love them!  They are comfortable and they keep my shoes from smelling after wearing them all day! ,2
2,4," I was so intrigued when I saw them advertised‚Ä¶ I waited for them for quite a while, LOL they took about a month to arrive I guess they were backordered because of the popularity. They take a little while to install ‚Ä¶ I bought two part/grips and one pair of liners for ballet flats. In use them with my Tieks..The silver thread that is woven into them must have amazing antimicrobial properties!   My only issue with him is that one of my pair of Tieks ballet flats now feels like it is too small at the toe!   This must just be due to the thickness of the sock/liner‚Ä¶  so this could be an issue for other customers, ",2

2,5,Love them!! ,2
2,5,My wife loves them!! She said they fit like a dream. Will definitely be buying some more in the future. ,2
2,5,Love them!,2
2,5,Great stuff - especially for my flats that no sock would ever fit in without showing. Thinking of purchasing for my moccasins too!,2
2,4,"A little tricky to get in the shoe, but very comfortable to wear,  and definitely helps with foot stank.  ",2
2,4,"A little tricky to get in the shoe, but very comfortable to wear,  and definitely helps with foot stank.  ",2
2,5,"Easy to install, stay in place, comfortable and keep from rubbing, chafing, and smelling!",2
2,5,So soft and comforable! Much more breathable than wearing normal no show socks,2
2,5,"Adore them, exactly what my daughter needed!",2
2,5,Love! Just wish shipping hadn't taken so long!,2
2,5,"Love my gekks, easy to put in and I'm going to be ordering more for all my shoes now! Worth the money ",2
2,5,Love them!!!,2
2,5,Love! Love! Love! I should have bought 50 grippers for all my flats!,2
2,5,love them,2
2,5,Easy to install and definitely help keep my feet less sweaty during the day! I have put them in all of my ballet flats!,2
2,5,"These make my Tieks more comfortable, and I love how they are no-show.",2
2,5,Perfect. They are exactly as advertised. ,2
2,5,But pricey. ,2
2,4,So far im liking them and they are comfortable but the shipping is really lacking will probably buy more in the future,2
2,5,Love them!!,2
2,4,They are pretty cool. Still getting used to them- shoes are a little tight now. ,2
2,4,"So far, so üòä ",2
2,5,The Gekks were absolutely perfect! I'll never buy anything else.,2
2,4,A great product. A bit pricey to get for every pair. I have over 100 pairs I could use these with. I only give 4 stars due to price.,2
2,5,Great solution to barefoot ballet flats ,2
2,5,The answer to my prayers! Pure genius! ,2
2,4,"These are great. Took me a bit to fit in shoes, but I really like. Live in Florida where it's hot most of time, so it's good to have a little protection against stinky shoes.",2
2,4,"They work pretty well, but do not always cover all of my toes and it can make my toes rub.",2
2,5,So far so good. I was a little nervous placing them in correctly but I can't even tell anything is in my shoe and they smell great without wearing any small nylon socks. ,2
2,4,They really make the shoes more comfortable.  What a cleaver idea,2
2,5,Perfect for my flats!! No more adjusting my socks all day!!,2
2,5,"So far they are great! Pretty easy to install, and comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, the new work shoes I put them in were unbearable to wear, so after one day of wearing them, I chose to remove the gripper set to return them -- you could barely tell the gripper sets had been in the shoes, which was great!  When I went to buy a new gripper set (for the replacement shoes), I regretted not purchasing an extra gripper set with my original order, as the cost of shipping was going to be another $4.90 (for a $2.50 gripper set).  Thankfully, Gekks had wonderful customer service and waived the shipping fee at my request, given the circumstances!  I definitely recommend Gekks, and my advice is to order an extra gripper set with your first order -- worth it!",2
2,5,Great socks!,2
2,5,Perfect for my Tieks!!,2
2,5,"Love them so far! I do think that they were a bit difficult to get installed, but once they were in, I'm thrilled with the results! It has bothered me for years that you could see little peeks of the no-show socks, when I wear my flats (almost every day to work). And now, you can't see them and I still have protection between my foot and the shoe! I am still waiting to see how they hold up over the next couple months, so I'll update if I have a chance later!! So far LOVE LOVE!! (....other than the fact that they took foreverrr to ship :)... still worth the wait though!)",2
2,5,So far so GREAT! Loving these in my Tieks! ,2
2,4,Fits one of my feet better than the other.,2
2,5,Awesome! So great. Make my day way better.,2
2,5,These are perfect in my Tieks! I tried several different socks and am so happy I found these.,2
2,5,I was never able to keep no-show shocks from falling off. (Or showing) these are great!  I will be ordering more. ,2
2,5,"Best thing in footwear...EVER!!!  I can't wear no show footie type socks as they always slip off my heel, tried Gekks and I'm going to order many more pairs!",2
2,4,Works. Makes sense. A bit hot because of the cotton. ,2
2,5,Better than I expected. Very comfortable.,2
2,5,I love that my beloved Tieks will be kept in better shape and my tootsies will be hugged.,2
2,5,"Love them, plan to get one for all my flats!",2
2,5,"Completely awesome. I have had trouble with my flats always smelling because i never wear socks and i end up hsving yo toss thrm after a few months. These are great!!! Only complaint is the cost, would be nkce to see a bundle price a little lower to help out for those of us who have tons of flats.",2
2,5,Very nice product.  I like the look and feel of the ballet flats. I love that I don't have to worry about sock liners anymore. ,2
2,5,Love them! They fit comfortably and keep my shoes from becoming smelly. ,2
2,4,"Work great in my flats
",2
2,5,Love them. Perfect no show fit and comfort. ,2
2,5,"Easy to install, extremely comfortable.",2
2,5,Comfy and exactly as advertised.,2
2,5,Exactly as described! Pretty miraculous!! No more stinky flats and pulling on footies sliding off my heels all day!!,2
2,5,Super easy install instructions. Very comfy like my feet are naked. W,2
2,5,"I wasn't very sure these would work even after receiving them. However, after inserting the first pair, I am so pleased! Gekks kept my feet comfortable in my casual shoes and stopped the heels from rubbing in dressier flats. I will definitely be ordering more!",2
2,4,"I think they'll be good. Summer will be the test. The first time I wore them, I got caught in a huge rain storm and my grippers didn't hold. However, this was an extreme situation. I'm hopeful that these will be a good solution for my feet this summer. ",2
2,5,They are amazing!,2
2,5,Work perfectly. Need more.,2
2,5,Worked well,2
2,5,Great replacement for no show socks. They are easy to install and stay in place. ,2
2,4,Really nice add to my Tieks...a little hard to get placed the right way...would be nice if they had a video how-to.  Will likely get a few more for my other shoes.,2
2,4,Really nice add to my Tieks...a little hard to get placed the right way...would be nice if they had a video how-to.  Will likely get a few more for my other shoes.,2
2,5,The only possible negative is a shoe that is borderline snug becomes a definite snug fit with Gekks.,2
2,5,"I love these, they're worth every penny in my opinion and I don't wear new flats without getting Gekks for them first now.  They really do control sweat and odor, I have been using them for about a year now in two pairs of flats and haven't needed to wash them yet.  Placing them was easy, and they're comfortable.  I haven't noticed them making my flats tighter, as some people have.  I didn't need them to stop rub, so I can't speak to that.",2
2,5,I learned about Gekks from Tieks. They work great to slip into flats and just go. No worry about odors in your shoes. Great invention.,2
2,4,These work well.  If I could start over I would be more careful putting them in.  Also an extra adhesives would be nice since I can see that mine isn't holding quite right.,2
2,5,Perfect!! I love these.,2
2,5,Perfect!! I love these.,2
2,5,I love the ballet flat Gekks. They have made my shoes so much comfortable and absorb all the moisture from my constantly sweating feet! ,2
2,5,I couldn't believe the difference these little guys make!,2
2,5,"Gekks have solved the ballet flat sock problem that has plagued me for years. The options for no-show socks made for ballet flats are pretty disappointing. They always peak out of the shoes, they slip off the heal, or shift in the shoe. They are also almost impossible to keep track of in my drawers. So far the Gekks I placed in one of my frequently worn ballet flats have solved all of these issues. They do not show at all. Of course they don't slip because they are attached to the shoe. They prevent rubbing in my heel and in the toe box. And almost the best part of all, I don't have to dig trough my sock drawer to find the perfect ""no-show"" sock for these shoes! I have yet to see if they really hold up to the no-stink claims. I have worn my flats with the Gekks about 3 times and no significant stink yet. But they are machine washable so I'm not too worried about it. ",2
2,5,A perfect and affordable solution to save your flats and prevent stinky feet!,2
2,5,I love Gekks! I wish I would have found them sooner. They make wearing my flats much more comfortable than trying to keep a low cut liner on my foot throughout the day.,2
2,5,BEST PURCHASE I'VE MADE IN A WHILE!! Worth the price for sure! ,2
2,5,So great! have changed my life! Thank you!!!,2
2,4,The heal grippers fall down sometimes.,2
2,5,They are so comfortable I don't even know I'm wearing them.  ,2
2,4,"The flats are great, but the shipping took forever - 21 days from order to delivery...",2
2,5,Gekks are awesome.  They are allowing me to comfortably wear shoes I could not in the past!,2
2,5,"Perfect solution for my work flats! I don't have to find no show socks everyday. I love that I don't have to fiddle with the aforementioned no show socks, pulling them up all day, etc. this product is great! I was confused on how to install them, but watching the video made it easy! I'll definitely be ordering more for other pairs of shoes! ",2
2,5,"These are the best thing EVER!  I have searched high and low for low-cut liners that will stay on my feet and not slip off.  THIS is the solution!!!  Gekks were easy to install, are comfortable, and STAY PUT!   ",2
2,5,These are great!!,2
2,5,Best shoes ever!,2
2,5,"These are the best! I have tried all kinds of low-slung socks and the always slip and/or show. I have 8 pairs of good leather Land's End ballet flats that I was not able to wear due to rubbing & blisters. With my Gekks I can wear them all - it was like getting 8 new pairs of shoes! Thanks, Gekks!",2
2,5,I love it!,2
2,4," I had to watch a video on how to apply them for it to make sense. They definitely help with sweat and odor. However while not uncomfortable, they aren't comfortable or soft either. I can ""feel"" them on my feet and my foot grip on my flats is different. I'm partial to them so far but I'll probably get used to them.",2
2,5,They took a few minutes to place in shoes but I found them comfortable and would recommend to others. ,2
2,5,"So far I love them. I have not worn them to work yet so I don't know if my feet will sweat or not, but so far, so good. They are very comfortable.",2
2,5,I love them!,2
2,5,Perfect for my Tieks!,2
2,4,"Work as advertised and definitely make my flats more comfortable. Only issue is I don't think the fabric is as odor absorbing as advertised. Seem to be as successful at it as any no-shoe socks I own. Would buy again because they truly do stay in place, it's pretty incredible",2
2,5,My wife really likes the Gekks Ballet Flats.  She put them in her driving shoes and love the freedom from having any sock showing!,2
2,5,The perfect sock for my ballet flats!,2
2,4,Works great,2
2,5,Simply genius. I love the Gekks for my flat shoes and am ordering some for all my shoes. ,2
2,5,"Best ""footie"" ever - wear ballet flats everyday ",2
2,5,This concept of socks far exceeded my expectations! I love them!,2
2,5,"Love them, once you figure out the installation they are a breeze.  Watch the online video!   They are very comfortable, easy to remove and wash.  Dry very quickly.  ",2
2,5,Great,2
2,5,work great,2
2,4,"It took a while for them to arrive but when they did, they are fabulous! Ordering more right now!",2
2,5,"Have not had a chance to wear them for a long period of time, yet, but they work well.  My shoes are super pointy flats that were rubbing blisters and the Gekks is the perfect barrier that doesn't show at all!",2
2,5,"I purchased the ballet flat and they fit perfectly inside the shoe, don't ""wiggle"" down inside of the shoe.  They are perfect!  It was so nice to wear my ballet flat shoes and not have to keep pulling the sock liner out of the shoe!  You won't regret this purchase!",2
2,4,"These were easy to put in and pretty comfortable, they work well with my ballet flats.",2
2,5,These really work,2
2,5,Gekks make my Teik flats even nicer to wear!,2
2,5,Love love love,2
2,5,I love them!  They stay in place and completely work keeping the smell out!,2
2,5,I love these!!  So comfy and don't have to worry about socks.  Love that they stay in place.  ,2
2,5,Sickles perfection. These perfectly suited my need. ,2
2,5,LOVE THEM!!!!,2
2,5,So far so good. I need to wear them a couple of time before I buy more.,2
2,5,Easy to install and very comfortable (wore for 10hrs).,2
2,5,They're great! They fit perfect. Weren't difficult to put in and so far no stinky feet. I'mspreading the word and already want another pair for my chucks. ,2
2,4,"On my right foot, the Gekks work perfectly; however, on my left foot my pinky toe doesn't seem to stay inside the sock. I'm not sure if it's my foot or the sock. It is less than ideal, but I still like them overall. ",2
2,4,"They are different for sure. I have worn them out once. They look secure with a sock feel, which I like. I haven't tried washing yet as they are still new .",2
2,5,Love the liners.  Seems to work better. Any chance of a new product for sandals?,2
2,5,"Awesome! They really work, no wet feet anymore. ",2
2,5,Great! Works well,2
2,5,Best purchase I've ever made in footwear. ,2
2,5,Love love love.  Perfect ! ,2
2,5,"Awesome! They really work, no wet feet anymore. ",2
2,4,Very good product I wear them in my Tieks. They are comfortable and stay in place.,2
2,5,Perfect! I will be using a bunch. love how they stick and don't slip out of my heel.,2
2,4,Need more length for size 11-12,2
2,4,"I think they are wonderful. They seem to be working great, my new shoes still smell like new!",2
2,5,"bought more for all my other pairs, plus sneakers, plus extra grippers.",2
2,5,Love these!  ,2
2,4,"I loved how they stayed in place on my heel, very comfortable. Will purchase again, the fabric itself could be softer...  ",2
2,5,"When mine arrived, I thought, ""this can't be what all the hypes about. I've been snookered."" Then I read the directions as I grabbed my favorite flats & put them in. AMAZING. Wish I knew about these a long time ago. Ordered more immediately. Never having no shows pop off my heal throughout my day again! ",2
2,5,Awesome I love them!,2
2,5,These were easy to put in my shoes & so far have worked great!,2
2,4,I've had these in for a couple of weeks and they seem to be working well.  The toe box in the ballet flat is a little shallow and my pinky toe slips out of the sock which can be uncomfortable.  That is the only reason I am giving 4 vs. 5 stars.,2
2,5,These are prefect!  No messing around with little socks that don't stay on your feet. These are so much easier and comfortable.,2
2,5,Love them,2
2,4,It's a little difficult to get the grippers in the type of flats I have but still happy with them. I'd love Gekks for heels! ,2
2,5,So far I'm loving my new Gekks and plan to purchase more!,2
2,4,I like them. They went in easily. I may have to order more!!,2
2,5,Total game changer for my ballet flats!,2
2,5,keep my feet dry,2
2,4,"I definitely love Gekks - this is my third pair, they look a little funny when the shoe is not on your foot but overall great purchase, as long as you put them in right when you buy your flats!",2
2,5,they secured into my flats better than I anticipated,2
2,5,First pair and LOVE them!! So glad I tried them. I'm planning to order more.:-),2
2,5,Love them. I have generally sweaty feet which means my flats get destroyed very quickly on the inside. These are perfect. They control odor and safe the linings of my flats ,2
2,5,These are so cool. Makes wearing ballet flats so much more comfortable. I can't wait to get more to wear with other shoes. ,2
2,5,I love my Gekks! They are easy to slip my foot in and out of and I haven't had any issues with sweaty or stinky feet! ,2
2,4,"Took me a little while to get used to them, but I do notice that my feet feel dryer with the Gekks.  I will probably buy another pair or two for my other shoes.",2
2,5,The Gekks worked perfectly! I had to go to a conference where I was on ny feet walking around for 3 days straight and they didn't budge! And my feet stayed smell-free. Awesome product! ,2
2,5,I loved them! They stayed in place the whole time. Will definitely be buying again.,2
2,5,"Easy to use, comfortable , really don't show!!!",2
2,5,They perform just as advertised. No slip and no stink! I love them!,2
2,5,Love them!,2
2,4,"I bought several pairs, of course different colors. I like but the grey is not grey, it's more a version of toupe.",2
2,5,I like the way they cover my toes and keep my feet from sweating.  I don't like how hard it is to get them in,2
2,5,These really work! I must wear socks and none of the footies I have tried will stay on when wearing my flats. All day it is annoying battle to keep them from bunching up. Not so with Gekks! My feet and shoes are protected and I can think of more important things besides how annoying my socks are!,2
2,5,Just installed them into my tieks!  I can't wait to wear them!  And they were so easy to install.  Can't wait to order more for my other shoes!  ,2
2,5,I really love my Gekks.  I have always had a problem with my feet sweating and my shoes smelling when I wear my ballet flats without socks.  My Gekks solve both of those problems for me and they are super comfortable.  I love that no one can see that they are in my shoe.  I will definitely be ordering more!,2
2,5,Worked great!,2
2,4,Wicks away additional sweat. So far no stink. ,2
2,5,"I LOVE these!  I will be ordering more for all my flats!!
",2
2,5,Finally my ballet flats are soft and comfortable on the inside. I love these gekks. I want them in all my shoes. ,2
2,4,Very easy to use in my everyday shoes. Absolutely no show. Love that. Only drawback is you can't just slip your foot in & go. You have to physically insert your toes in to the toe area. Then they're fine. ,2
2,5,These are wonderful!! They stay in place and no odor!,2
2,5,perfect fit for ballerina flats!,2
2,5,I got them for my daughters work shoes.  She loves them ,2
2,5,I got them for my daughters work shoes.  She loves them ,2
2,5,Love LOVE love my first pair of Gekks. I found myself at my office crossing my legs and my shoe would slip off and I could immediately smell the stink. Embarrassing.  Put my gekks in that same shoe and no odor! All day wear of perfection! Just waiting for the High Heel version to come out now! Will definitely be buying more. ,2
2,5,"They stay perfectly in place and feel comfortable, exactly what I needed. I am recommending to everyone I know!",2
2,5,Love the feel and fit of my ballet flats with Gekks!,2
2,5,Fits perfectly into my Tieks and their so comfortable!,2
2,5,"Takes some work to get everything installed the first time, but worth it! The Flats style, in particular, fit great and lay smooth. They didn't affect the fit of my shoes much, and yes - they control odor effectively.",2
2,5,Super comfy and no smelly shoes!,2
2,5,"A dream come true!  Great fit, comfortable, don't even notice them. They don't slide around, bunch up or sag down.",2
2,4,They do stay in place and prevent friction between skin and shoe.  I wish they were a little thicker.  ,2
2,5,These are great! No more do I have to deal with little socks that show and don't stay on. ,2
2,5,daughter loved them,2
2,5,"Not sure how these would work and skeptical that I would like them. First day, I loved them! I need a pair for every flat!!!",2
2,4,"Really breathable and easy to apply. 

",2
2,5,Love that they are not visible and I don't have to wear nylons or socks,2
2,5,These are fantastic! A whole new world with my shoes!,2
2,4,"They were a little difficult to ""install"" but great product!",2
2,5,"I love my Gekks, they fit perfectly in my tieks and even give me that little extra bit of warmth that makes ballet flats more cozy in cool temps.",2
2,4,I absolutely love my ballet flats! They are the most comfortable shoes that I own. They have so many color choices. You can wear them with jeans or wear them with your best dress. They definitely get a 5 star rating from me.,2
2,5,Amazing!!,2
2,5,Good,2
2,5,Awesome! Works!,2
2,5,It's what I need it!!!,2
2,5,They fit well in my shoe,2
2,5,Love my ballet Gekks!,2
2,5,Yes like,2
2,5,Fit great and very comfortable ,2
2,5,I was a little skeptical but these are great! So easy to wear and comfortable - I hardly know they're on. The installation was pretty simple also. Just follow the instructions and everything is securely in place. No slipping or sliding. ,2
2,5,They are so comfy!,2
2,4,"These ballet flats work perfectly as a stay in place sock, and I've bought more for all of my sisters and friends. My only complaint is that they aren't as good at odor control in odor prone shoes as I hoped they would be. ",2
2,5,Love them! Why hasn't anyone thought of this before???,2
2,5,Super comfy.  Just like wearing a thin little sock inside your flat.  Best part--no show!!,2
2,5,Worked great!,2
2,5,Works great. Will buy more for all my ballet flats ,2
2,5,"Love these, just put them in and don't worry about them. No more adjustments because they've slipped off my foot!",2
2,5,So comfortable and work great! Thank you!,2
2,4,Good concept I love not wearing socks but still having something between my foot and my flats. Not convinced about durability though ,2
2,5,Great! ,2
2,5,Loved it! No more stinky feet ,2
2,5,These work like a charm! I got them to keep my Tieks ballet flats preserved and they do just that. Very comfortable. ,2
2,4,I haven't installed them yet,2
2,5,Love them! ,2
2,4,"They're good, but not perfect. They come down a little too low and sometimes slip off my pinky toes, causing rubbing.",2
2,5,So easy to put in and so comfortable to wear! Getting the holders for all my slip-ons!,2
2,5,So far so good!,2
2,5,Amazing!!!,2
2,4, Very comfortable ,2
2,5,"Makes the shoes so much better, no more inside of the shoe sticking to your foot ",2
2,5,Absolutely loved them! I wish I would have had these when I first ordered my Tieks! They are worth every penny! Can't wait to order more. ,2
2,5,"Great product
",2
2,4,Works well so far! Toes slip off a little though. Need to see if it really reduces odor over time ,2
2,4,Very comfortable in Tieks; definitely met my expectations. However shipping them out to me took longer than expected and I was not notified of delay until after I placed my order. ,2
2,5,I love these things! They're perfect for my Tieks!!,2
2,4,Very comfortable in Tieks; definitely met my expectations. However shipping them out to me took longer than expected and I was not notified of delay until after I placed my order. ,2
2,5,"I mad the mistake of putting them in loafers, not as easy duh but I love them nonetheless ",2
2,5,"Fit great. Really take the ""stink"" out. Love them. Will be buying more ;) ",2
2,5,So easy to use and wear! Would happily have Gekks in every pair of shoes I have!,2
2,4,"Weird but good! Wish there was a little more stretch in the toe part of the lining, but love them.",2
2,5,"They are awesome.... ordered some for gifts and extra grippers! Great idea, great product!",2
2,5,see review on loafers,2
2,5,see review on loafers,2
2,4,"Overall I enjoy the Gekks product. Easy to install, invisible in my flats and prevents odor. Only issue is that the heel pad did not stick and caused a blister.",2
2,5,Somewhat easy to install and are very comfortable. I would recommend new users to install these in new shoes that are a half size larger than you would normally wear.,2
2,4,"I do wish they were a little thicker, maybe a bit thicker for the winter months.",2
2,5,Absolutely comfortable and works great!,2
2,5,"I wasn't sure, but I really like these!  They keep my feet from sweating and they're still comfortable and don't add bulk.  ",2
2,5,"They are the most comfortable and beautiful shoes! The first time I wore them to a 50's birthday party and danced all night. I love the,.

",2
2,5,Fit great in high heels too! So so so happy :),2
2,5,"I love them !! They're so easy to ""install"" and comfortable. They make my shoes much easier to wear.",2
2,4,Like then,2
2,5,"Love them.  I put them in a brand new pair of flats and after only wearing them for a couple of hours, I ordered more sets for other shoes.",2
2,5,"Great product. Doesn't show in my shoes, and made my flats more comfortable.",2
2,5,Love them!,2
2,5,These are amazing!!,2
2,4,"I really like these Gekks. I am NOT a fan of wearing ballet flats without socks, and I think the typical footie sock is irritating. These are a great solution. Sometimes frustrating to get my toes into the ""sock"" but otherwise I like them a lot.",2
2,4,"These are awesome! Although the toe area seems thin, and I think it may wear through rather quickly. ",2
2,5,Great product!,2
2,5,They are amazing !!!,2
2,5,"comfy, work great, easy to install in shoes",2
2,4,So far so good! We will see how well they wash!,2
2,5,I love them! ,2
2,4,Sock seems a bit small but overall great,2
2,5,love these!,2
2,4,I've only worn them once so far. I'm getting used to the feeling of the liners. I can already tell that I won't get blisters in my flats and that they will help with moisture control. ,2
2,5,Love them.,2
2,5,I love it very easy to insert in shoe. ,2
2,4,"I would give four and a half stars if I could because there is one improvement which I think might be possiblebut I will mention that at the end.  I was very skeptical but I was wrong.  I love them!!  After wearing them for several weeks they are still fresh and feel the same.  They really don't slip in ballet flats, which is lovely!  My feet no longer stick and my ballet flats which I love to wear are wonderful..  The four stars is because I fell like my feet sweat a bit more when I wear them. I a in the middle of a midwestern winter so it is not a question of hot weather!!  I wish that the mixture included some wool.  I think this would solve the problem of sweaty feet.  I will for sure be ordering more as soon as it warms up and I don't need real socks.   ",2
2,5,They surpassed my expectations! They make the shoes so much more comfortable. I'm going to order 2 more pair! ,2
2,5,Awesome shoes! Great quality and so comfortable!!,2
2,5,"Soft, comfortable, perfect",2
2,4,"I am really enjoying my ballet flat gekks. My only complaint is that my pinky toe keeps wanting to escape from the gekk on my right foot (that sounds really silly to say üòÑ). Anywho, either my foot is too wide or maybe the toe compartments could be made a teensy bit deeper? Just a suggestion. Thanks for these awesome socks! Now my husband doesn't call me by my mother's name whenever I take off my shoes!!! (She has really stinky feet üòÅ)",2
2,5,"So comfortable, best shoes I have ever owned and they hold up so well! I get tons of compliment. Definitely worth it!!!!!!!",2
2,5,So functional!,2
2,5,"So comfortable, best shoes I have ever owned and they hold up so well! I get tons of compliment. Definitely worth it!!!!!!!",2
2,4,I will be buying more. No show socks either show or fall off. These are great.  ,2
2,4,"They are a little hard to install, but I was able to pull them out and redo them so there weren't any bumps. I really like the option of removing the liner so I can wear tights with the shoes. Great versatility!",2
2,4,"I love these inserts in my ballet flats, however I wish the adhesive was easier to remove for the future.",2
2,5,"They feel great! Slightly tricky to install, but the directions are very clear",2
2,5,Love them..very comfortable.  I'll order again!,2
2,5,"Perfect, even in 1-in heels!",2
2,5,They are so comfortable!!!,2
2,5,Perfect,2
2,5,These have been a fantastic find.  I love the fact that they help control smell.  I also love that I can just slip my foot in and I am ready to go.  So much more comfortable than trying to also wear half socks with the shoes. I have ordered a few more for other shoes.,2
2,5,Easy to use and comfortable ,2
2,5,Very Awesome!,2
2,5,Good product ,2
2,5,"Haven't used them long enough to know if they'll keep scents away, but so far so good!",2
2,5,"I love these for my flats. I don't like having my feet touch the shoe without a barrier, and these are thin enough to not impact the fit but still prevent the weird dampness as well as the odor that develops over time. ",2
2,4,"I am still getting used the the GEKKS liner, but overall, I think that I am going to love them! I really appreciated the online video showing how to install them. I'm looking forward to wearing them more, and I'm telling my friends about them.",2
2,5,"Great so far! put them in a pair of ballet flats and seem to be working so far, but I have only had them in for about a week.",2
2,4,i love the ballet flats. I just hope they will hold up.,2
2,5,So comfortable and protects my toes from blisters!,2
2,5,They fit perfectly into the shoe and are comfortable. I could never wear ballet flats without peds but those always showed and looked terrible. Not a problem at all with these! ,2
2,4,"They seem to work well. Installation was easy. Shipping was slow, though.",2
2,5,Works great! ,2
2,5,These are great!  No more footies that slip off my feet ,2
2,4,Awesome design!! Hard to wash. ,2
2,5,Awesome.,2
2,5,"So far so good! I love not having to worry about wearing separate liners or socks in my ballet flats, and no more odor eaters insoles!  My feet feel dry all day! ",2
2,4,"shipping was very slow, but the product was exactly what I was looking for. gekks are very comfortable and easy enough to install. i will be recommending them!",2
2,5,Love them!,2
2,4,"Perfect match for my Tieks! No show, no stink and added comfort!",2
2,5,"They were easy to insert into shoes and are easy to slip my foot into them!  I was pleasantly impressed!
",2
2,5,"Just love them. I also bought a pair for my daughter, waiting for her to decide how many and which styles she wants so we can order together. I was shocked the large fit(just barely) my huge size 12 feet- but we made it. I keep forgetting that they can stay in the shoe and keep looking for something  else to remove when I take my shoes off.",2
2,5,"These have been such life savers.  I hate having bare feet but I hate having other socks on with ballet flat shoes because they show and that looks so tacky.  These are the PERFECT solution.  Easy to use, comfortable, well priced - I don't think I've ever been so happy in my life with a purchase I made online.  ",2
2,5,"The gripper was easier to insert in the ballet flat. It's nice to have them, especially since my heel is much narrower than the front of my foot. The Gekk helped keep my heel from slipping.",2
2,5,"They feel great, keep my feet feeling dry and there is no smell after all day of wear! Love them! ",2
2,5,So far so good! I have even been using them in flats that were already a little stinky and no smell after a whole day at work!!,2
2,5,I can't wait to get more for my other flats!,2
2,5,These are so genius!,2
2,4,Love them,2
2,5,I really love how they stay in place on my feet. A plus for my sweaty feet.,2
2,5,so comfortable and convenient. buying sets for all of my flats!,2
2,5,"I've worn them once, and i love them!",2
2,4,"Directions for installation were not very clear, but once I got them in, I really like them. They keep my feet feeling fresh and are easy to slip in and out of. Perfect for the black ballet flats I often wear to work.",2
2,5,"Love them, they fit great and are super comfortable",2
2,5,Great for flats that expose little sockies. This takes place of the need for little sockies and get stuck right in the shoe!,2
2,5,They fot perfectly into all of my flats and are so comfortable to wear!!!,2
2,5,"So happy I can throw out my little sock liner things that always fall off my heel. Great idea, great product, easy to put in. Will be buying some as gifts this Christmas!",2
2,4,"Very comfortable and work well, although sometimes the gripper part and the ""sock"" part come apart while walking so it sticks to tights/hose. ",2
2,5,They worked really well.  I'm happy with how they felt and they were easy to put in.,2
2,4,"Like my Gekks, just not sure they are worth $16.",2
2,5,Love these! Such a great idea,2
2,5,"I absolutely adore my Tieks, but there is no way to wear a pair of socks comfortably with them. Gekks have made my amazing shoes even better! No more stinky shoes, no more trying to keep no-show socks on my heel, and no more worrying about if my socks are showing. Gekks are the best!",2
2,5,They are the best I've tried!,2
2,4,They really work well in my flats.   ,2
2,5,Best flats everrrrrr! So soft and comfortable. I'm definitely buying more.,2
2,5,"They were a bit confusing to install as many others have said in their reviews. But once I got them in, they are great! They even help with some of the fit issues I was having with the shoes.",2
2,4,I love the idea of these.  I cannot wait to see how they work out over time.  It's great that I don't have to change them to different shoes.  I can just put in a pair and never have to worry about moving them to another pair of shoes. ,2
2,5,I love them! They work so well!,2
2,5,So much better than those tiny socks that never stay on your foot!,2
2,5,They are great! Comfortable too,2
2,5,They are great! Fit well and very comfy.,2
2,4,Too soon to tell too much.  East to use/install.  I need to wear my shoes a few more times.,2
2,4,"Getting the sticky part perfect in my shoes was really hard. Other than that I really love my Gekks, especially because they make sure my feet don't stink after wearing flats with no socks all day. ",2
2,5,These are fantastic! ,2
2,5,"I love them! They really do work! I bought them specifically for my new Tieks and they fit perfectly. The only word of caution would be don't try to install them, especially in foldable flats that keep rolling up, when you're tired or irritated for any reason. That sticky part on the inserts is no joke. üòâ Once they're in place though, they stay. ",2
2,4,Once you figure out how to put them in correctly (I didn't the first time) they are nice.,2
2,4,"I received my Gekks a couple of weeks ago, after waiting several weeks for them to be delivered because they were on back order. I like them a lot...it's nice to be able to slide a bare foot into a ballet slipper without having to use a sock or stocking. I had some issues sticking the heel grip into the shoes, and one of them crumpled a little. Because of this, the Gekks liner is not completely secure (or comfortable). It would be helpful to have an additional set of heel grips in each set in case of a mishap like mine. Other than that, so far, so good.",2
2,5,Absolutely love this product. No more sweaty feet or that weird noise my flats would make as my heel would rub on the inside. Easy to apply too! ,2
2,5,Wonderful addition to my Tieks!,2
2,5,So great!,2
2,5,Absolutely love my ballet flats! So glad I took a chance and purchased them!,2
2,5,They fit in my shoes really well!,2
2,4,They were easy to insert in the shoes.!!,2
2,5,Love!,2
2,4,I think they are very comfortable. I was hoping for something I could move from shoe to shoe...,2
2,4,Great product but terribly slow shipping.  No phone number the contact the company and emails were never returned.  ,2
2,5,Great concept and surprisingly simple to use. Haven't worn them multiple days yet to make sure the lining stays put but they seem to be solid so I'm optimistic! ,2
2,5,So great! used in new flats that have caused blisters before but the gekks helped with keeping my foot from sliding and the shoes rubbing!  I'm so glad I ordered two sets...I will get more and give as gifts to my daughter and bff's!  Every woman should have Gekks!,2
2,4,I love the concept...they were easy to install and I love the fact that you can remove and wash them. I didn't care for the part around my toes so I actually cut it out basically making a removable washable insole which I love! It would be great if they were offered!,2
2,5,"I love them!  It took me a few minutes to figure how to attach  the gripper to the shoe, but once I did, my second pair of went quickly.  They were so thin that my shoes fit better, my feet didn't sweat and swell like they often do.  I am taking stock of my shoes now and plan to order more soon.  I do think I'll order the whole Gekk for each shoe.  It is a nice feature to be able to move them from shoe to shoe, but I wonder how long the gripper will last if I keep removing the Gekk. Thanks for this great product.",2
2,5,Perfect for my flats and definitely no show!!,2
2,5,"These are amazing - my other little flat ""socks"" always slipped down and started to make their escape off my foot...my Gekks ballet flats ""socks"" stayed in place, my feet stayed dry and comfortable and most importantly, there was no rolling under my arch.  I highly recommend to anyone who wears flats and I'll be buying these for loafers!",2
2,5,So cool!,2
2,5,Fits well and just starting to use it so will have to see on long term usage.,2
2,4,This product really works especially with shoes that are made of man made materials.  I've ordered twice.  The only down side is the toe area.  This should just be flat.  Your toes kind of feel scrunched up like too tight socks.  ,2
2,5,Life changing! I don't have smelly feet but my feet would always rub and I would get blisters. That is no longer happening!,2
2,5,"I've worn the flats I put them into twice and loved the way it felt both times. The true test will be after a number of additional wears, but these are by far the most comfortable and functional options I have come across. ",2
2,5,I love geks!  They fit perfectly in my tiek ballet flats! I wore them all day with no problems.,2
2,5,I love these. I have them in all of my ballet flats,2
2,5,"I always have to wear socks, but my socks can never be seen. I have one pair of loafers that I've never been able to find socks that aren't visible and don't slip off my feet. Gekks are everything I want. I feel like i'm wearing socks and they never move and they they can't be seen. They're amazing. ",2
2,4,"These were a little harder to get my foot in and out of, but I still really like them! They keep my feet from smelling. I wasn't to try them with heals. ",2
2,5,"Gekks, where have you been all my life?!  Love this great new idea & bought more!",2
2,5,"Gekks, where have you been all my life?!  Love this great new idea & bought more!",2
2,4,"In Florida, it is possible to go barefoot all year long. But most employers do not approve of bare feet in the workplace...even after a pedi! So most days, I wear ballet flats over my bare feet. I saw an ad for Gekks and thought that I would try it out.  I've have them in my shoes for about a week now, and I must saw that they exceeded my expectations. My Gekks are comfortable and help with the issues of odor control, better than I expected. Only a couple of small issues-- 1. Placement of the grippers can be difficult originally. Placing them in just the right spot can be a challenge the first time, but the Gekk sock makes up for any slight errors. And 2. I was cursed with long feet and toes... I wear a size 10. The first few time I wore my ballet flat with my Gekks it was a little awkward getting ALL my toes into the little pocket on the end (my little piggy on the end still misses out sometimes...), but after a week, my Gekks are starting to mold to my foot a little better.  Bottom line: a great product!  I just wish my feet weren't so unaccomodating.  :) ",2
2,5,Love my.  Working on getting one in every color.  ,2
2,5,LOVE THESE!,2
2,5,Great product,2
2,5,I love these inserts! ,2
2,5,I'm loving them.. I'm wearing them in tieks and not affecting the comfort at all! ,2
2,5,"These are super easy to insert, and they are literally saving my feet and my ballet flats!",2
2,5,These are great!,2
2,4,My favorite leather ballet flats never make my feet stinky anymore. Thank Jesus.,2
2,4,"I have worn my Gekks twice in my Tieks ballet flats. They are very warm especially living in south Florida, but there is no stench and very comfortable. I also love that they're hidden within my ballet flats. I will definitely purchase another pair in the future!",2
2,4,I like the Gekks sockless because they don't ride or slide in my shoes. I'm glad to he found something that works.,2
2,4,They do control the sweat and smell factor. I feel my feet a bit sweaty but it's hardly anything compared to not having the Gekks on. They do work!,2
2,4,"So far I like using the Gekks for Ballet Flats. The toe can be a little tricky to get aligned right across my toes when I slide on my shoes, but one I've got them on, I'm set for the day. I never used to wear flats without socks because I hate sweaty feet in shoes, but Gekks solve that problem for me.",2
2,4,"Trying my Gekks for the first time today...so far so good! Feels like I'm wearing thin socks and my feet don't feel sweaty like they normally would, mid way through the work day.",2
2,4,"These ballet liners are truly fantastic! Fit well, and very comfortable. To make them """"5 star"""" is to have an extra set of attachment so the liners can be worn in more than one pair of shoes- added value!",2
2,4,"They work really well, I would like it if I could use them in different shoes without having to purchase additional liners.",2
2,5,"This was the perfect solution to my work flats...no need to choose between unflattering """"hidden"""" socks or sweaty feet!",2
2,5,Definitely buying more for my other pair of Tieks!,2
2,5,"I was a little skeptical that Gekks would slip and slide like every other shoe liner I've tried. I was so impressed when they didn't that I raved about them to my coworkers and my husband. I saw a few days later that he was struggling to keep his tiny, no-show socks in place. I went online that night and ordered some Gekks for him (and a few more for me).",2
2,5,Finally able to wear my flats without sweaty feet and stinky shoes. I can wash them as needed!,2
2,5,Great - work as described.,2
2,5,"I'm surprised and very pleasantly so. These socks are not seen but provide amazing comfort while I wear my Tieks. Very easy to """"install"""".",2
2,5,Love Gekks! Will buy more for my other shooes!,2
2,5,"I'm so happy I found these! I have several ballet flats for work, but hate when the """"no-show"""" socks show. These are true NO-show socks, easy to put in your shoes, and very comfortable! I love my Gekks!",2
2,5,I really like my Gekks! They are so comfortable... I will order more in the future.,2
2,5,"I put a pair into my Tieks ballet flats and they have made all the difference. The heel cutout was a little large, so I had to trim off the top, but other than that, these are awesome! My feet feel so much drier and comfortable in my Tieks than without Gekks.",2
2,5,These work really great for ballet flats. I put them in already stinky flats and it even helped get rid of that along with preventing new smells!,2
2,5,"I am really enjoying my Gekks. So easy to apply, and very comfy.",2
2,5,"My shoes don't stink, my feet don't stink. The grippers were easy to install and the sock is comfortable.",2
2,5,They were easy to place in my shoes and are comfortable. I have to wait a bit to see if they keep the shoes from getting stinky... check back in a few weeks!,2
2,5,"Easy to customize fit to the shoe and very
comfortable.",2
2,5,I have worn the same flats almost every day for two weeks since putting in my new Gekks. There is still no odor whatsoever. They do not slide around at all inside the shoe and bonus: The sock toe is saving my pedicure!,2
2,5,Does the job exactly as I had hoped it would but smells even better and even more comfy. I forget I have them on.,2
2,5,Must-Have items for girls.,2
2,5,"I was really excited to try these and then had a lot of trouble putting them into my flats, and that resulted in being able to feel the liner while walking - it was rubbing and uncomfortable. When I reached out to Gekks about the issue they asked me to explain a bit more and send a photo and then happily sent me a replacement pair to try again. Very good customer service!",2
2,5,These are awesome! I wear them daily and love their ease and comfort. I found it easier to install the gripper to the heel by going from the middle to the outer edge. I will be buying more of these in other styles for my other shoes.,2
2,5,"I live ballet flats, but have ruined too many pairs with foot odor to wear them without socks. Those no-show socks were never comfortable though and I was always fighting to keep them in place. These gekks were exactly what I was hoping for. They're comfortable, odor-absorbing, stay perfectly in place, and are easy to care for. I was concerned the Velcro pad would be too thick in my shoe, but I don't even notice it's there. It also was simple to place after reading the instructions.",2
2,5,I was skeptical but now I'm a convert! I'm throwing away all of my old socks that never stay put and replacing them with Gekks! I am very happy with my purchase and already recommend them to my friends!,2
2,5,"I was reluctant to believe the description, but I was proven wrong! Gekks really do everything they advertise. I feel confident in knowing my feet are dry and 'odor-less'. I love my Gekks !",2
2,5,Bought the ballet flats for my wife for Christmas and she loves them! They work great and will be buying more! ,2
2,4,I have only worn that pair of flats once but I liked them. I thought the part under your foot would be more comfortable if it was a smooth surface rather than the bumpy surface. I haven't tried to move them to another pair of shoes so I am not sure how easy this will be. ,2
2,4,I have only worn that pair of flats once but I liked them. I thought the part under your foot would be more comfortable if it was a smooth surface rather than the bumpy surface. I haven't tried to move them to another pair of shoes so I am not sure how easy this will be. ,2
2,5,"I ordered 4 pair - 3 worked great.  Unfortunately, I mistakenly ordered the 4th pair in the wrong size.  Is there anyway to exchange?",2
2,5,These are awesome!  I love that I don't have to constantly buy and wash those annoying toe covers that never stay in place! ,2
2,5,My daughter loves them!,2
2,5,fit perfectly and made my shoes more comfortable to wear!,2
2,5,"Perfect fit for my Tieks! They are amazing, light, breathable - I plan on getting a pair for all of my flats!  ",2
2,5,"great concept!
",2
2,5,Great idea!  Works perfectly ,2
2,5,Great idea!  Works perfectly ,2
2,5,"Love these inserts. The fit was perfect; smooth, secure, and easy to slip your toes into the end of the sock pocket.  ",2
2,5,So much better than anything I have tried in my shoes.,2
2,5,These work wonderfully with my ballet flats! ,2
2,5,I was hopeful gekks would live up to their promise. These socks certainly changed my life. No more unsightly socks showing and no more smelly. I'm grateful that you've made this product! I've since bought more for friends and family to try.,2
2,5,Great choice for your shoes when you want to go sockless.,2
2,5,"It works great. It was a bit complicated to figure out how to put it on, and I didn't realize it was like a slider SOCK vs. a shoe liner, but I think this is brilliant and it's helped a lot with no odor going sockless!",2
2,5,"I was blessed with sweaty feet...all year long. These are lifesavers! My feet are much drier and I don't slip and slide in my flats. LOVE THEM! I will be buying more soon!

Thanks so much!",2
2,5,I think Gekks are the secret to not having stinky gross shoes! Love them!,2
2,5,I've used my Gekks once so far but that were wonderful. They took about an hour of getting used to and then I couldn't even tell they were in my shoe!,2
2,5,I put these in the only flats I can stand on in my classroom all day long - my Tiekks - and they're perfect. I'm so glad I have a way to protect my expensive shoes from the constant use they get. Thank you!,2
2,5,I was very surprised at how comfortable these are. They help with any foot sweat or smell and make the shoe even more comfy! I will be purchasing for all of my flats!,2
2,5,The installation was pretty simple. You need to be careful when removing for washing as it seems pretty easy to detach the sock from the backing but other than that they are comfortable and easy to use.,2
2,5,"These are great! I dislike going sock-less (my feet sweat-how gross) and I‚Äôve tried the mini socks but they just don‚Äôt stay on my feet. What a brilliant idea to secure the,m to the shoe! I‚Äôm going to get a couple me since I have a pair of flats in every color.",2
2,5,"Love my Gekks, need more for my other shoes!",2
2,5,These really work! I'm very pleased!,2
2,5,"I am using them in my Tieks and they are amazing! No smell, very comfortable and they don't show at all!!",2
2,5,"May I say I have sweaty feet! Sorry, but it's true! I have ruined many a lovely pair of ballet flats but these Geeks have saved them! Very comfortable too!",2
2,5,Gekks are great!,2
2,5,Very comfortable and stay in place. They don't show when no show socklets do.,2
2,5,Will buy many more pairs! Reduces foot smell !!!!,2
2,5,I bought my first pair for a pair of life stride wedges that are my go to work shoes. They fit and work great. I don't even notice they are in my shoes.,2
2,5,They are very comfortable. I would like to purchase additional liners.,2
2,5,I have only worn the Gekks for ballet flats once but so far I think they are great!,2
2,5,Very comfortable! Takes a little while to get the soles setup in your shoes but really enjoying them so far!,2
2,5,I received the Gekks for my ballet flats a few weeks ago. They were relatively easy to install and they've made my flats much more comfortable to wear especially during summer in Texas. I will most likely order more.,2
2,5,An hour excellent solution to wearing ballet flats without blisters,2
2,5,"Solved my problem with those other """"no show socks"""" and my flats which always slip down. A little hard to put in but the online video was very helpful. Will definitely be purchasing another pair!",2
2,5,"I bought these hoping they would solve the issue of my little toes rubbing inside a pair of flats that I really love.
Well, problem solved. Gekks are soft. Hidden and stay in place. I will absolutely be buying more for my slip on converse. Regular socks are too thick and the footy socks slip off",2
2,5,Great idea...now I can wear shoes instead of sandals for dress in the summer!,2
2,5,They don't slip and they are easy to use! YAY!,2
2,5,"I'm not comfortable without some kind of sock, and odor has been a problem too. I also need to wear closed shoes at work. No matter how low cut they were, any shoe liners I tried would show. These are perfect. I have them in black and nude and will get more.",2
2,5,"most low/no show socks slide around, bunch up, and are uncomfortable to wear. These are amazingly comfortable, and smell-free! Awesome. A little pricey, but worth it.",2
2,5,Will be purchasing more for sure!!!!!,2
2,5,Once people get to experience Gekks there are going to be no more socks! These are amazing and I am so happy I was introduced to them. I will be ordering a pair for ALL of my shoes!!,2
2,5,What a phenomenal product!!!!!!!! This product is ingenuous. Very comfortable. I highly recommend!,2
2,5,"Wowie. I was referred to Gekks because my tiny socks never stay in place for all my favorite flats. There's nothing worse than constantly pulling a heel back in place, or adjusting the toes juuuust right so your socks don't show at the toe line. Gekks seemed too good to be true, but I was desperate! Holy moly, I am in love. I need them for all of my shoes! """"Installation"""" instructions were clear and easy to follow. I can't feel the socks when I'm wearing the shoes. I can take my feet out midday without fear of stinking up my cubicle with sockless foot funk. I can go up and down five flights of stairs without fear of my socks getting out of line. I'm in LOVE!! I haven't had to wash them yet (been wearing off and on for two weeks - maybe four or five days of actual all day wear?), and they are going strong. Definitely ordering more, and can't wait to see what they come out with for heels!",2
2,5,"I suffer from stinky shoes - I've tried sprays, peds (which show), and wearing nylons (only work for pants). I saw an ad for Gekks on Facebook and decided to try it on. The installation is a little annoying - my heel doesn't want to totally smooth out - but I am definitely getting more!!!",2
2,5,"I've always hated wearing flats because either they require those tiny fake socks that dig into my heels and scrunch down all day, or you can go sockless and they smell absolutely awful. But I'm no fan of high heels either. I'd tried a bunch of different tiny socks to solve the flat problem, but Gekks aren't even just better than the tiny socks -- it's like they totally eliminate all my problems with flats. An account of my day: 1) Gekks are always right in my shoes, eliminating the need to hunt around for matching tiny socks (which are impossible to find despite the fact that I own probably 12 pairs of them); 2) Gekks are both more comfortable than not wearing socks with flats AND than wearing socks with flats: they don't slide around or scrunch down during the day, but there is still the moisture-absorption and toe protection from the inside of the shoe; 3) my feet do not smell EVER. Not while I'm wearing them, not right after I take them off, not when I stuff my shoes in my gym bag and leave them for 3 days. 4) these cost me pretty much what a week's worth of tiny socks cost, and yet I only need 1 pair; 5) Less laundry = more time to enjoy life. I might need these for all my shoes.",2
2,5,"These are wonderful. They stay in place, remove easily to wash, and are so comfortable.
I was surprised to see the change in design,( my other Gekks have a sticky silicon back that holds them in) I just hope that the grippers will remove without damaging my shoes.
If you hate footies as bad as I do order these now!",2
2,5,Love them! An easy answer to wanting to wear socks but the shoes are too low.,2
2,5,"I installed my Gekks in my favorite pair of Crocs flats -- love my Crocs but my feet get so sweaty. Feet still sweat but it's absorbed by the Gekks. They wash well, too! Will definitely purchase more!",2
2,5,Works great,2
2,5,"Very clever! No more sweaty, slide-y feet inside my work flats! Thank you!",2
2,5,"I have pretty serious foot odor and my gekks for ballet flats have completely cured it! I used to have to buy cheap flats, because I knew I'd be throwing them away in a month or two from the smell, but gekks have completely changed the game. I can now wear the last pair of my favorite, now-discontinued, flats without worrying or airing them out every hour! Thank you, gekks!",2
2,5,"Bought my first pair, ballet Gekks; very comfortable, no sliding down in the back like other shoe liners. No more sweaty feet! Thanks!",2
2,5,"LOVE these Gekks! I wore them every day in the same shoes for four days, tramping all over a hotel convention. Never slipped, never smelled! Comfy all day.",2
2,5,"I got the low cut Gekks for women's slip on shoes. I was amazed the first time I used them. I can't even feel them on my feet (unlike """"no show"""" socks) and they don't slip off. And at the end of the day, my feet don't stink! Love them! And will be buying more in the future!",2
2,5,I only bought one pair to make sure I liked them. I love them. It makes going sockless so much more comfortable. And none of the Gekks showed. I also love that you can remove the sock portion and wash them after each use. I will definitely buy more.,2
2,5,"Love this product! A bit awkward to install, but I was able to re-position the insert and everything worked out fine.",2
2,5,"I have used my Gekks in my Tieks on several occasions, and even after wearing them for an entire day each time, there was no foot odor, and unlike most no show socks, these stay in place. These are wonderful.",2
2,5,I love these... They are very comfortable and let's me go sock less while wearing my flats..,2
2,5,"Great for shoes that are low cut. Suggest getting size larger than your shoe. Wish I'd of gotten a larger size. Personally I'd like them to come up on the side a tad more, but they work for me as I hate wearing shoes without socks. I would definitely buy another pair.",2
2,5,I have been forever trying to find the perfect sock for my flats and a tough critic but these really work and I will be ordering more!!!,2
2,5,I got a nice pair of Tieks and thought I'd try the ballet flat Gekks. They're perfect! I can avoid those little mini-socks that slip off my heels every two seconds. Amazing. Will be a repeat customer.,2
1,5,"I LOVE my Gekks!  It‚Äôs not just that it‚Äôs no-socks fashion.. it‚Äôs that once I‚Äôve slipped my feet into my Gekks filled shoes, I forget about it all.  My feet love it so much that they won‚Äôt tolerate any other kind of socks.  I‚Äôve worn my Gekks in loafers and ballerina flats so far and I just wish they were more packs...like sneakers  packs and loafers-flats packs.  I used to wear Birkenstock sandals and holed out rubber shoes all the time until I was forced to wear closed shoes.  THIS is better.",1
1,4,"So here's the deal, I really like the socks.  I'm still a little put off by the price point and some of the sales tactics. The exact prices escape my memory now, but I bought enough to get the 15% off, which I think was somewhere in the ball park of $60... for a few pairs of socks. Once the 15% was applied, it apparently put me under the threshold for free shipping.  So I was tempted to go back and add more, but then I realize I'm about to be $80 deep into socks that I don't even know if I'll like yet. So I begrudgingly continue as is and pay their shipping. At this price point, and with no physical locations, I think the company could spring for shipping...... ",1
1,5,They are awesome! They don‚Äôt show and are comfortable. Nice variety in this pack. ,1
1,5,Awesome,1
1,5,Easy to use and great for my shoes ,1
1,5,"Great!
",1
1,5,Great product. Love the variety ,1
1,5,They are excellent. So glad I got them. Really help make my shoes more comfortable. ,1
1,5,They are easy to install and I love how they feel!  Great product!,1
1,5,"Fantastic 
I did not realize that finding,choosing and putting on socks 
Was such a hassle till I found these 
They are the best ",1
1,5,"Fantastic 
I did not realize that finding,choosing and putting on socks 
Was such a hassle till I found these 
They are the best ",1
1,5,I am impressed. They are soft and comfortable and really do prevent sweaty foot smells!,1
1,5,Love it! I was initially intimated by the installation but it was a lot easier than I thought. And you get better at it with having to do it more than once! ,1
1,4,Not worth the money,1
1,5,"I completely didn't think they would work but they did and they stayed in place. Really great product. 
",1
1,5,Loving it,1
1,5,"Convenient, soft and comfortable. Super service",1
1,5,I love my Gekks! The closet pack allowed me to fit several different kinds of shoes. No more slipping socks!,1
1,5,Grate ,1
1,4,"I'm amazed at how well these work. I put my Gekks in my work shoes and wore them barefoot all day. There was zero odor at the end of the day, which was amazing. The inserts are a flimsier than I expected, but they stay in my shoe and I don't feel them at all.",1
1,4,Like the products but think price is to high.,1
1,4,fits great and really comfy!,1
1,5,"Love the closet pack.  Had a chance to test out the Gekks in several different kinds of footwear.  Also ordered the Gekks for heels. Feet feel so comfortable in them and, as promised, no evidence of the socks sticking out of the shoe. Am a believer.  There will be some Gekk ""stocking"" stuffers for Christmas!",1
1,4,Pretty simple to use.  Seem to stick on well.  Neat idea.,1
1,4,"I undoubtedly prefer gekks over other no-show socks, or going sockless. I do question, however, whether I should have gotten a bigger size. My feet are size 6.5 and I went with the small, though I felt I had to stretch them out considerably to insert them into my loafers properly. I do love that you don't notice them while walking and they do appear to prevent blisters at the heel. Very pleased so far! Looking forward to trialing in my flats as well.  ",1
1,5,Highly convenient and friendly,1
1,4,I was a little skeptical when I got the package but I'm a fan now.  They really do work.  It's nice to have that moisture wicking fabric on your shoes without having to wear stockings or socks.   These really do work!,1
1,4,It definitely works like a sock. It‚Äôs convenient & comfortable. Unfortunately the back did slide down a bit but it did save me from getting blisters. I recommend them. ,1
1,4,I have only used the loafer and flats gekks. They are amazing!,1
1,5,True love!,1
1,5,"I think Gekks are great! Once they are in the shoes, I just slip on my shoes and I‚Äôm out the door! No more worrying about socks. The feel smooth and comforting on my feet. The Women‚Äôs Closet Pack took care of three pairs at once!",1
1,4,"comfy overalll, but i wish there was more coverage of the back end of the shoe sideways. ",1
1,5,"I am very happy with my Gekks purchase.  I put one in a pair of ballet flats that I haven‚Äôt worn for a while because they have a plastic footbed inside the shoe that made my feet sweat and no matter what sock liner I tried, it always slipped down in the shoe and that was aggravating and uncomfortable.   I put another pair in my Converse Shorelines and i love the way they look and feel!  No more sock liners slipping down my heal. Thank you. ",1
1,4,Love the feel and fit of these sock!,1
1,5,"I absolutely love the Gekks I ordered. One pair didn't want to stick. I contacted the company, and they are sending me a replacement pair!",1
1,4,Great!,1
1,5,love them!!!,1
1,5,They are really cool! Wish they weren't as expensive as they are because i'd like to get more.,1
1,5,I was surprised by how well they stay in my sneakers. They are comfortable and keep my feet from sweating.  Haven‚Äôt tried them in my other shoes but I‚Äôm anxious to do so. ,1
1,5,They are comfortable,1
1,5,Exceeded my expectations! Totally helped with foot funk and diminished my need to find any other ‚Äúno-slip‚Äù socks. Fan for life!,1
1,5,Love the ease of use and comfort,1
1,4,"Have been using them for about 1 week, and so far they are great! Love the ease, not needing to put on socks, and they are extremely comfortable!  My only gripe is that the back piece is a bit tall for some of my flats-  so I had to scrunch it down at the heel so that the gekks material doesn't stick out over the top of the shoe. Not a big deal, though, and it wasn't a problem with sneakers. So glad I tried them! Looking forward to seeing how they hold up over time.",1
1,5,perfect..especially when you get one free!!,1
1,5,So much better than the previous design with the sticky velcro!,1
1,5,I love this product. The fact that it stayed in place and my feet were comfortable is a big plus.,1
1,5,Very pleased. Will be ordering more in the near future. Highly recommend!,1
1,5,Easy to use and so comfortable ,1
1,4,I like the concept.  I struggle getting them on when they are firmly attached to the shoe.  ,1
1,4,love that you don't really even know you have them in your shoe,1
1,4,"Heel portion fits a bit weird,but overall I am satisfied with the products.
",1
1,4,"Great concept and instructions but two issues:

1. No matter how the loafer Geks are positioned/adjusted they bunch in the corner bottom of the heel. 

2. The moment the weather went over 26 degrees Celsius, the backs started peeling away from the shoes in all three pair. ",1
1,5,Awesome,1
1,5,Awesome,1
1,4,They're cool. ,1
1,5,Love them!,1
1,5,"So far so good!  I have been searching for an alternative for my flat ballet shoes and this seems to be the answer, very happy! Thanks",1
1,5,Three more shoes are ‚Äúgeeks‚Äù now,1
1,5,Love them!üíï,1
1,4,"I struggled with the loafer insert and then moved on to the ballet insert as I was leaving on a short trip the following morning. Even though I think I may have ordered a touch small the ballet insert was great.  So nice to not be loosing the ‚Äúsocks‚Äù at the heel and constantly removing a shoe to retrieve them. 
I will update my review when I‚Äôve had a chance to try the loafer and sneaker insert but until then the ballet is a keeper!",1
1,4,"I like them; haven‚Äôt had a chance to use All of them yet for different style shoes, but they have worked out in my ballet style shoe!",1
1,5,I love these inserts but I ordered the wrong size.  I should've ordered 6 1/2 but ordered the 7.  I take either a 6 1/2 or 7 shoes so thought the 7 would be better.  I 7 is actually a little too big but I'm using them anyway.  Next time I order I go with the 6 1/2.  ,1
1,5,My summer look has leveled-up.,1
1,4,I like it.,1
1,5,Love them!,1
1,4,I love them now that we can make our own closet pack.  I just order a closet pack of flats.  Please add heels to   3 pack,1
1,4,"Love them so far. I've tried the loafer and the sneaker style and they're both awesome. My only issue is that the lime green trim on the heel is a little conspicuous. Since the trim may be slightly visible depending on the shoe, a neutral thread colour would help. They've been amazing otherwise!",1
1,5,Easy to apply. Definitely useful!,1
1,5,"Great! The toes of the flats curl back after a few uses, but otherwise, they work as advertised.",1
1,4,I like the flats and loafer Gekks very much and easy to get placed comfortably but the athletic shoe Gekks is very hard to get placed right and bunches up quite a bit. Like the concept very much but will stick with a low inner sock for athletic shoes. ,1
1,5,It was a gift. My daughter loved it!,1
1,5,"They work great, a little inflatable for my toes at first but after about 30 min they stretch and settle into blister-free wear.  I'm impressed how well they stay in place and they are super comfortable and cool.",1
1,4,Cool concept. Difficult with some shoes to slip your foot in without catching the back corner and peeling out the back.,1
1,5,"I was skeptical at first, and I have only used my sneaker gekks so far but I love them.  I am definitely coming back for more!",1
1,5,Love my gekks!  They work great in every shoe I've tried so far.,1
1,5,"Love, love, love them!!",1
1,5,First sock liners that don't slide off the heel. Love them!,1
1,5,"The pack arrived in a timely fashion, and I‚Äôm very happy with the product. They were easy to insert in my shoes, they really are no-show, and they stay in place and are comfortable.",1

1,4,Loved how easy it is to put gekks into my shoes! Wish they were a little bit cheaper.,1
1,4,Very expensive for what they are but happy to wear them,1
1,4,"I love the gekks in general; however, I have one pair of shoes that the adhesive does not stick to (the upper is a stretchy woven canvas).  The #4 patch will not stick, no matter what I do.  ",1
1,5,This was my second Gekks purchase. I love these things!,1
1,5,"Love them!  I needed some good, nonslip socks, and these are better than I could have imagined!",1
1,5,Good socks,1
1,5,"Never going back to socks!  Love the fit, feel and ease. ",1
1,4,Great shoe inserts. Glad I got the closet pack. Keep my feet dry and they don‚Äôt show. ,1
1,5,This closet pack was a perfect way to try out 3 of the gekks' styles. I've been really impressed with all three and will be ordering more!,1
1,4,"They are awesome, i did not realize they stick and stay attached. But I still like them!!!",1
1,5,"LOVE these! 
",1
1,4,A little bit awkward to insert‚Äîbut very comfortable once placed!,1
1,5,"Life changing. I wish there was a style for booties, but the loafer ones seem to work ok. It‚Äôs so wonderful to have socks that don‚Äôt slip down!!!! I put a testimonial on my Facebook page and told everyone to buy them! LOL! ",1
1,5,Love my gekks!,1
1,4,I would have preferred more for ballet flats and heels but didn't realize that before I got them. I do love the concept,1
1,5,"Awesome! Comfortable, dry feet after a long day! And, no visible socks or slippage!",1
1,5,LOVE Them!!! Easy to install and soft on my feet. I typically wear no socks in my loafers and flats but always feel sweaty at the end of the day. Gekks help keep them dry and callous free. Will order more to fit in all of my shoes. Great product!,1
1,5,"I love the comfort of my new Gekks.  These were so easy to insert in my flats, sneakers and heels.  No more annoying socks slipping into my shoes.  Great product.",1
1,5,These actually stayed in place and made my shoes so much more comfortable.,1
1,5,These actually stayed in place and made my shoes so much more comfortable.,1
1,5,Easy to install and very comfortable!,1
1,5,"Great idea. I use these in my Tieks flats and they don‚Äôt sleep, squeak or get sweaty. I use these in my Allbirds tennis shoes to prevent smell without socks. Work great! Would recommend to anyone who‚Äôs looking to go sockless or protect their shoes from sweaty feet. ",1
1,5,"Love them, they work perfectly ",1
1,5,I LOVE my gekks!! I started with just the ones for flats but then realized they should be in all my shoes! It takes a little more effort to install them on the tennis shoe and loafer models but worth it - keeps my shoes smelling great and i dont have to worry about my socks falling down.,1
1,5,Great solution to now show sock woes! I loved the women‚Äôs closet pack I ordered and I plan on ordering more for all of my ballet flats. They are so comfy and convenient. I wish I‚Äôd ordered them sooner!,1
1,5,I was skeptical at first but willing to give them a try and they've worked great!,1
1,5,"Great product. So far I have ""installed"" two out of three in shoes. Very comfy once adjusted properly. 
",1
1,5,"The closet pack of Gekks was great. I have Sperry loafers and a pair of slip on Sperry loafers that I used the ballet flat insert in. It worked perfectly. I have had them in for a couple weeks now and they are fantastic. No more ruining my shoes with feet sweat or wearing the tiny socks that don't stay put. Even the Sperry brand liners showed when wearing the slip-on angelfish loafers. It looked horrid and the socks (even with the rubber grippy stuff) did not stay in place. I bought my usual size shoes as the Gekks liners have no added bulk to speak of. They are very thin. These are not like socks they truly are a liner. They do what they are supposed to and they stay in place. The sticky stuff on the Gekks can be recharged by cleaning with hand sanitizer or soap and water and then dried. It's made out of the stuff that the reusable lint roller you see advertised on tv is made out of. it is re-stickable. I would argue that they are a bit on the expensive side, but they save my shoes and my sanity, so there's that...",1
1,5,I am very happy with these. They stay put - my feet would always hurt at the end of the day because the traditional booties I‚Äôve purchased in the past to wear with flats would roll down under my foot. These do not and I‚Äôve moved these to other shoes and they have worked great. ,1
1,4,"A little difficult to get in place, but once that was accomplished they have stayed right where I want them.  Working well!",1

1,5,Great love them ,1
1,5,Love them!,1
1,4,"I haven't yet used all the Gekks, but those that I have a great. I also bought a pair for heels that I've been using in my flats and those are fabulous. I plan to get more of these. I waited a long to make an initial purchase, but am glad I did. Your feet stay comfortable and cool. I don't have smelly feet problem but damp leather is not pleasant either, with Gekks this is no longer an issue. ",1
1,5,Love the improvements to the installation. The socks stay in place with much less effort than the previous versions. I will definitely order more! ,1
1,5,"These are better than I expected! They apply easily, and are very comfortable.  ",1
1,5,At last - something that really works ,1
1,4,I really love these.  It's a lot of money to spend on something that is basically a sock substitute but they're pretty awesome.,1
1,4,I really liked how they fit in the shoe without peeking out and they‚Äôre so soft.,1
1,4,"I think I may like them. Two of my Gekks arrived and the paper that covers the sticky area were gone. So, I have waited to put them in my flats until now....summer shoes.",1
1,5,I loved them.  I ordered an additional insert for another pair of converse I have.,1
1,4,"works well, used them in my flats and my sneakers.
",1
1,5,Work just as promised and saved my feet from blisters. I need more!,1
1,5,This is such an awesome idea for socks! Why didn't someone think of this sooner? The socks stay in place even after multiple wearings and -- no -- they do NOT have an odor! I absolutely LOVE these socks! I'm telling everyone!,1
1,5,I love these! I don't always like the look of socks with certain shoes and these are absolutely perfect!!,1
1,5,"So, it took me a long time to order the $50 socks...but now I'm totally obsessed with them!  I want them for every shoe I own.  I love them!!",1
1,4,So far they meet my expectations and the ballet flat option are the best! ,1
1,5,"These might be the greatest invention of all time. As someone with smelly, sweaty feet when I go sickles, these saved my life.  No sweat.  No smell.  No slip.  No see.  Amazing.  ",1
1,5,"Perfect!  I was a little hesitant that these would work, but so far so good.  No slipping or stretching out.  I have not washed them yet, but they are exceeding my expectations.  They work really well with Toms, which is why I ordered them in the first place.",1
1,4,A bit difficult to place in shoes üëü ,1
1,5,these are exactly what I need!  great invention!,1
1,5,Love Gekks so much.  ,1
1,5,"Worked like a charm!  No show, no fussing and really no odor left in shoes!  Would recommend.",1
1,5,Amazing! Socks that don‚Äôt slip off! ,1
1,5,Awesome ,1
1,5,I love these shoe liners!  I can wear my cute ballerinas all day without any chafing.  I'll be ordering more.,1
1,5,It looked complicated at first but all the numbered steps made so much sense after putting one in! It‚Äôs super comfortable and makes it so much easier to enjoy my shoes. It‚Äôs awesome! ,1
1,5,Love these.  They work great and stay in place!  Would recommend them for anyone who likes to go sockless or even with pantyhose. ,1
1,5,Excellent! No more socks wading up under my feet as I walk!,1
1,5,"I love these! So far I have used the heels and loafer ones and they are easy to insert (after the first one). The only problem I had inserting these was getting my mind out of the way!!  They feel lije I'm wearing socks and all the comfort. I haven't removed them yet, but I don't foresee any issues.",1
1,5, Great for flats,1
1,5,"Wonderful product!  I ordered the closet pack and each size was easy to place into the corresponding shoe.  Very comfortable, you can‚Äôt tell there is anything in the shoe.  So far, they have stayed in place, no movement or sliding in the shoe.  I‚Äôm looking forward to purchasing a few more.  ",1
1,5,They meet all my expectations! Thanks,1
1,5,"So far so good . I have not tried washing them yet . I did have one pair where the sticky stuff stayed in the shoe , had to peel it off , wanted to put in a different pair of shoes . Seems to be ok . ",1
1,5,The best invention ever!,1
1,5,Great starter set to try the various styles. I don‚Äôt wear heels anymore but the heel pair worked perfectly in a ballet flat. Coming back for more- these are def worth the investment.,1
1,4,I'm new to Gekks. LOVE the sneakers Gekks and looking forward wearing the loafer Gekks.  Not real sure about the ballet flat Gekks yet.  Seems the toe part may be a bit small.,1
1,5,I bought a multipack and so far have no complaints!,1
1,5,They are soooo comfortable. I cannot wait to order more soon. The one thing I couldn't remember for certain is can you move a pair from shoe to shoe (from one pair to another) and does the sticking power remain?,1
1,5,Love my Women's Closet Packland! I previously purchased one pair of gekks for my flats and loved them so much I knew I needed and wanted more. This pack is very useful and covers all of my shoe needs!!,1
1,5,These are amazing- comfortable and no odor!,1
1,4,Still getting used to them... So far so good.  I have only used 1 pair and I like it,1
1,5,I love them. I have tried all 3 pair. It took my most smelliest shoes to ,1
1,5,"So far they have actually exceeded all of my expectations. As I have small feet, the available sizing options clinched the deal. ",1
1,5,love the variety-put them in all my shoes.  No longer do my no show socks fall off during the day.,1
1,5,I think they are great. I have only had them for a short time but so far so good and I ordered another closet pack!,1
1,4,Work great!,1
1,4,"Love the flat socks and even ordered more. Still waiting to use the other, but I am sure they will be great. Especially excited that there was no foot odor at the end of the day. ü§¢",1
1,5,Love them. No heel slipping off to annoy you. Keep feet comfy and dry with no smelly feet. Plan to order a few more pair ,1
1,4,"I was skeptical at first, but overall I really like them. I have used them for a few weeks now and have washed and dried them. I am sure there is an end life to the stickers, but so far so good!  I would be great if they sold replacement stickers to put overtop of the existing when you needed a refresh!  The toe of the socks is a little slippery in some shoes - it would be great if they could make them grip a bit better. ",1
1,4,Found the adhesive strips hard to work with.,1
1,5,so far so good! They are easy to put on and very comfortable.,1
1,5,"Gekks are great! They work perfectly in my Tieks. Why did I wait so long to try them?? I purchased two more pairs, and will continue to purcahse.",1
1,4,"Haven't tried all 3pr yet, but the pr for flats worked perfectly with the flat slip-ons ai wore today. I love that no sock fabric was peaking up out of my shoe. Very clever design!",1
1,4,"I ordered these socks with skepticism, but they work pretty well.  Absolutely no show and pretty comfortable.  I haven‚Äôt washed and reinserted them in my shoes yet, so I can‚Äôt comment on how well the adhesive sticks after washing.  (The instructions say if the adhesive loses its stickiness, they should be washed) So far, I like them.",1
1,4,"Love my gekks in my loafer slip-on, no slips or falls! ",1
1,5,Love Gekks!  The set is a good starter pack or adding to what you have already.,1
1,5,"This is such a terrific idea!  No socks that slip off of my heel, or show over the tops of my shoes!  They are thin and comfortable, and stay put.  The closet pack was a good way to try them all.",1
1,5,Best items to wear with shoes EVER!!!!,1
1,5,Love the ballet flats and heels Gekks. Will be ordering more. ,1
1,5,Love these. No more re adjusting the no shows all day long. ,1
1,5,loved. fit in my shoes perfectly. would recommended especially for sneakers.,1
1,5,Love the ones for flats. Ordered more. ,1
1,5,"This is the perfect way to try out all of the different styles! I have the sneakers in my Converse and they are the best thing ever! Comes with easy to follow instructions, and they truly keep your feet feeling fresh all day! Best ‚Äúsocks‚Äù ever!!!",1
1,5,Comfy,1
1,5, I love these!  Easy to put into shoes and makes slipping shoes in and off easy.  I will be buying more!,1
1,5,"I love the Gekks, but I think they are VERY expensive.",1
1,5,I have large feet and no show socks never stay on-I love these socks!!!!,1
1,4,Like them so far,1
1,4,"These are pretty awesome, but my one complaint is about the seam at the top of the heel.  If your shoes are even a little bit snug, it will dig into the back of your heel really bad--I had a huge red indentation a couple hours into the morning.  Other than that, however, I absolutely love them!",1
1,5,"I was very skeptical about these liners as Ive tried countless others without success. These little things, although don't look much, are absolutely amazing! Used them in converse low tops, ballet flats & heels. You can hardly feel they're there after a few minutes on & prevented my feet sweating hence no more smelly shoes! üòä  I can not review whether the glue will restick if removed, washed & replaced as I have not had the need yet. I don't tend to wear the same shoes day in & day out. I do have one small gripe the backs (sticks to the heel portion of shoe) were slightly too long & could be seen above the top of my shoes. I had to push them down causing a little bunching at the heel & on one pair I had to cut the end off to prevent it showing. Overall, I would highly recommend these if you do not like bare feet in shoes (which I do not. üëçüèª) Shipping was very slow without explanation until I emailed. Apparently they have an overwhelming demand of orders. Be patient, they are soooo worth the wait.",1
1,4,So far they seem to work well. The videos are easy to follow and they were easy to install. I've only gotten to try the ballet style ones but they were comfortable.,1
1,5,Great!,1
1,4,"It is what it is.  Would have liked to be able to choose a color, but otherwise, it is 3 sets of liners for 3 different types of shoes.  So far, they work great, are comfortable, don't slip around.  Ordered more Ballet Flat liners as that's mostly what I wear. Very interested to see how they hold up after washing.",1
1,5,Fantastic!,1
1,5,"I'm buying more for all my shoes!!  Hate to wear little peds, they always fall off!  This is a great üí°!",1
1,5,Love them!!!,1
1,5,Love Gekks!  I hate wearing socks with my shoes... Gekks make my shoes more comfortable.  Lasted 2 full days at Disneyland with none of the usual discomfort!  Yay for Gekks!!!,1
1,5,Great product! Love 'em!,1
1,5,These are great. East to install and vertical comfortable to wear. ,1
1,4,"Overall I really do like these. The ballet flats package works perfectly with my Tieks and they really do help with foot odor! I am still trying to get used to the loafers and sneakers socks. Sometimes it's a bit tricky to comfortably put on my shoes, but it's getting better.  I still recommend these. ",1
1,5,"These are genius! I was so nervous to install them because I didn‚Äôt want to mess them up, but once I did the first pair to whipped through the other three with no issues at all! They are definitely living up to all of the things that they claimed to do! ",1
1,5,I wish I would have gotten all three for flats.  I was not sure what the loafer and tennis shoe ones were like:(  Not sure I will ever use them but have recently ordered more for my flats.  :),1
1,5,Super!,1
1,5,I love the product. I will be purchasing more!,1
1,5,"This is my second purchase, but for myself this time.   My first purchase was for my husbands Sperry's and he loves them.  They are super comfortable, easy to install and makes wearing your favorite shoes even better.  I look forward to having them in my shoes.  Thanks for offering the bundle deal and promos.
",1
1,4,"I love the Gekks, but am unhappy with the promises made at the time I ordered. I ordered 2 Women's Closet Packs and was supposed to receive a free pair with each packet. I received none. ",1
1,5,love them!,1
1,5,Finally found a product that keeps my feet covered!  No slipping and they feel great!,1
1,4,The product is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!  The service not as much.  I was not able to use multiple coupons/offers (which was fine but they didn't say that I couldn't; shipping and % off) and the two emails I sent service went unanswered.  Growing pains I suspect but it's hard for me to recommend to others; again amazing product but the buying is at your own risk.,1
1,5,Very comfortable. Easy to wash. ,1
1,5,I absolutely love them! It makes wearing any kind of shoe comfortable without the inconvenience of having regular socks that never stay up!,1
1,5,Love it!,1
1,4,I really like the concept.  They don't stay put after a few wears the tape doesn't hold the toe and heal in place.  Will need to buy more tape part s,1
1,5,Love them!,1
1,5,Love them,1
1,5,Perfect! They fit my shoes perfectly without showing and keep my feet from sweating in slip on tennis shoes. Should be able to wear them all winter and keep my feet dry and warm. ,1
1,5,Perfect! They fit my shoes perfectly without showing and keep my feet from sweating in slip on tennis shoes. Should be able to wear them all winter and keep my feet dry and warm. ,1
1,5,Great!,1
1,5,"It was great, was able to use on all my new fall shoes and ready to go. Love them :-)",1
1,4,I like them. Very comfortable ,1
1,5,They are great!,1
1,4,I like the variety but found the loader style difficult to attach to my shoes.  I wish the closet pack could be just a discount when purchase 3 or more. I don't necessarily need all three types in the same colors,1
1,4,These are great! Easy to insert. Stays put all day. Slimmer than a sock and doesn't show! No rubbing or blisters!! LOVE!,1
1,4,"I like them, however the heel needs to be bigger",1
1,5,LOVE!,1
1,5,Tricky putting it in for the first time but after that very nice and would recommend. ,1
1,4,"I found the gekks a bit difficult to install even after watching the videos, and a little tight in my shoes, but after wearing them for a while they felt comfortable. I am using them in shoes that specifically have missing or damaged insoles, to cover up the bottoms that are uncomfortable or stick to my bare feet.",1
1,5,They really solve the problem of wearing shoes without socks and look great.,1
1,5,They work EXACTLY as advertised. Love them!,1
1,4,"I love the antimicrobial liner. The ballet flats liner worked much better for me than the others, as the loafers and sneakers liner came loose only after 1 wear.",1
1,4,Seems to work great.  Shipping took over a month!,1
1,5,Very happy with my purchase. Looking forward to a new ‚Äúsockless‚Äù life.,1
1,5,Great product and value.  Really like the Gekks!,1
1,5,"I love gekks! They are so comfortable and they stay hidden iin my shoes. Plus, no more slipping heels.",1
1,5,"The new design is great.  I now have my favorite shoes lined with Gekkes.  So nice to just slip into them without socks, powder or the old fashion peds.  You have a great product.",1
1,5,Gekks are makes things easier when you don't want socks to show. I can't stand how sweaty my feet get without socks but that didn't happen with the Gekks lining the shoes. Good purchase!,1
1,4,"I really like them, I just wish the set came with more then one pair of the ""sock"" inserts.  This way you had more time to wash them.
",1
1,5,They are amazing and love the fit!,1
1,4,Overall I liked them but they were difficult to put into place,1
1,5,"So far I've only used the ones
For sneakers but love them!!",1
1,4,"A little challenging to ""install"" but they work great and I plan to buy more!",1
1,5,"Great product, love the ballerina slipper ones and the Toms ones, the sneaker one is a little hard to get use to but I'm sure in time it will be fine.  I want everyone to have them now.",1
1,5,I love these! They fit really well in the shoes I intended and were easy to install. I've been using them for the last couple weeks in my sneakers and absolutely love it. They keep the back of my shoe from giving me blisters - a major improvement so that now I can wear my favorite sneakers without socks showing. ,1
1,5,These are great!  I am so happy that I don't have to fuss with socks anymore. ,1
1,4,"So far I have put one in my flats and sneakers, however the one made for sneakers is difficult to put in and position correctly.  I will have to clean them and try to re-apply to see if I can make them work properly.",1
1,5,Love it !,1
1,5,Absolutely love them!  Very comfortable.,1
1,5,"This was the best creation ever, I loved the feel of Gekks and everything about it.",1
1,5,I love my Gekks,1
1,4,"Great fit.
",1
1,5,"These really surprised me. I was expecting the typical Peds/loafer footies. Instead, these secure inside your shoes and can be worn forever. Will definitely be buying more.",1
1,5,perfect fit for the summer sneaker or loafers,1
1,4,I‚Äôve only used the flats/heels one so far and love them! However if I found that my feet still get sweaty so it would be great if the material could be sweat wicking as well.,1
1,4,Love these! They are easy to install and the care instructions are simple. My only comment would be that the tongue part should be a little longer. When I slip my foot into the shoe it tends to unstick. But other than that I'm glad I got these!,1
1,5,"This is a game-changer! I have now renewed my love for some shoes I couldn't wear because of various sock or lack of sock wearing issues!! I will shout from the rooftops, Gekks Rock!!",1
1,5,"Not exaggerating to say these are a life changing product for me. Worrying about foot odour is a thing of the past! And, having to change an entire outfit last minute because I can‚Äôt find the right socks for the right shoes? Never again! ",1
1,4,Overall I like the product but they seem a little small.  I got the large as I am a size 11 and they have to stretch pretty good to fit.  Thankfully the glue is very sticky so the product stays on my shoe but the sock itself doesn't fully cover my foot so I still have a few of the same problems.,1
1,5,Amazing product! Love love love! ,1
1,4,Loved them... wish they had an extra sticker for mess ups,1
1,4,"I like these, but it is difficult to apply the holders to shoes that have a tongue.  On my ""loafer"" pair, the tongue attacher has come completely off on the left shoe, which is disappointing.  However, the gekks are still usable and I am quite happy with those in and of themselves.  Honestly, I don't even think the tongue attacher is necessary at all once the heel and footbed are attached.  8/10 I'll probably order again.",1
1,5,Comfy and easy to use!,1
1,5,"I've purchased the women's closet packs for myself, my daughter and granddaughter.  We all love them.  We like that they don't slip off while being worn and that they come up to cover your feet but don't show over the tops of shoes.  They are great.",1
1,5,Loved them! Easy to use and super comfy. ,1
1,4,"I like these a lot, they're very soft and comfortable. I didn't realize they were intended to be left in the shoes so ideally I would need a pair for each pair of shoes. A little pricey for that but I love them. ",1
1,5,"Finally! A way to have the look of no socks with cute slip ons and no sweaty, clammy feet. I got the closet packet so I could try each size with the appropriate shoe. They're so great, I ordered another one and four more pair of the loafer size. They take a bit of finesse to get everything in the shoe, but once you get the hang of it, they attach pretty easily. You feel like you're wearing thin socks, but nothing shows. No nasty bulge of peds at the heel, no slipping down under the heel. Love them. Thanks for a great product. ",1
1,5,"Easy to use and so soft, my feet are happy :) ",1
1,4,"The product fit nicely into my loafers & keds, easy install. As usual they were kind of a pain to put into Tieks but once in there they work out great.  I was not well pleased with my contact with customer service but my order did finally arrive. ",1
1,5,They stay in place surprisingly well!  ,1
1,5,Love my gekks! Will definitely order more and recommend to family and friends!,1
1,5,Love the idea. Used the ballet flat ones only so far. ,1
1,5,I've had them for about 2 weeks and so far I love them. I have used the ballet liners in a pair of Rothy's and the loafer liner ina pair of Sketchers and both have worked wonderfully. ,1
1,4,Like the Gekks. Customer service needs attention. ,1
1,5,Fantastic ,1
1,5,Comfortable and easy instructions,1
1,4,"I like the idea of these.....had a difficult time getting the sticky insole in....until I reversed the direction steps ( I bought additional insoles for other shoes).  The ""loafer"" size was too large in the vamp of the loafers I own & actually fit better into deck shoes which are similar to sneaker. I may cut the heel off of  the loafer one and try them in a mule shoe I have.....BUT one for the ballet flats are PERFECT. I will see how these 3 wear for a while before purchasing more. Thanks gekks!!",1
1,5,This pack is a great solution for ballet shoes or sneakers!,1
1,4,Great product :) ,1
1,5,"so far I've only used the flats and it considerably benefit from sweaty feet. I use only leather shoes, but in Miami weather is always unforgiving for our feet. I should've ordered more socks for flats. ",1
1,5,Once I started using Gekks I was able to get comfortable in shoes without socks. It made a huge difference as my feet sweat a lot. This package takes car of all my needs! I may need another pack!,1
1,5,I recommend these to everyone!,1
1,5,"These fit great in my shoes as well as quick shipping, I want to get some for my husband now!  ",1
1,5,"Much better than the ""invisible"" alternatives I've wasted so much money on. ",1
1,5,"I have not tried all of them, just the ballet shoe, but I liked it very much.  However, I also purchased the Men's loafer for my husband and wish that there was better directions for the tongue sticker.
",1
1,5,very nice. highly recommend. my family loved them,1
1,5,What a great idea! I'm really glad I purchased these.,1
1,4,They are pretty good but you have to be careful with the install to make sure there's no wrinkles,1
1,5,I am pleasantly surprised with these. They were comfortable and did not smell after several uses. I look forward to using them in all my shoes. ,1
1,5,These are amazing! So much better than the tiny no-show socks that always DO show. Getting these for my sister for her birthday!,1
1,4,They are great! Easier than socks and my shoes are odor free! The adhesives are the reason I did not give 5 stars. They have already peeled off and I made sure I was extra careful when applying them. I ordered extra adhesives hoping to swap out my  gekks into other shoes but it looks like I will be using them to replace the adhesives that peeled off. ,1
1,4,Way better than the little socks I used to wear!!! Just wish I could transfer them into different shoes easier!,1
1,5,I love these! They made my difficult shoes so easy to wear and a lot more comfortable. ,1
1,4,For the most part I like Gekks. It's kind of a pain to get the adhesive on perfectly and maybe my feet sweat too much but I've worn them in a pair of Chucks twice and the adhesive has shifted. ,1
1,5,Love these for travel because you don't have to pack socks or peds/knee high stockings except for your walking/running shoes. ,1
1,5,"These are fantastic, fit great and are comfortable!
",1
1,4,I have only used the sneaker Gekks so far and I do like them.  They are a little tricky to install and my feet tend to get warm in them but they definitely make it possible to wear my Chuck Taylors without socks.  I love that there is no slipping or rubbing.  ,1
1,5,They work well and don't make the inside of the shoe bulky. ,1
1,5,They work well and don't make the inside of the shoe bulky. ,1
1,5,My wife loves her Gekks - so nice to not have to wear short athletic socks or be uncomfortable with footies that don't stay on her feet.,1
1,5,Met all my expectations and more!!,1
1,4,"Once I figured them out they work perfect in my ballet flats.  But that said, it was not real obvious when I made my purchase that they were not interchangeable with shoes easily.  I would have preferred a three pack of ballet flats in hind site, not sure I'll use the other two much.",1
1,5,"Gekks are outstanding, easy to slip into and totally smell free!",1
1,5,"I love how these work. I've used them in a pair of flats so far and I am pleased with the results. After trying my first order, I ordered extra fasteners to put in other flats as well as ordering a couple more sets of the Gekks for flats. I wasn't quite sure how they worked when I purchased them but I was intrigued. I would discribe them as a sock bottom, toe piece, and heel back that are secured to the shoe with a Velcro type strip. The results look as if you are not wearing socks, with the comfort of socks. They made wearing my flats very comfortable. ",1
1,5,Glad to stop fighting with half socks that don't stay put!,1
1,4,"I found these easy to use, and appreciate that they fit my three most worn pairs of shoes.  Their special silver threads help with eliminating the dreaded stinky shoe issue that comes from going sockless in the summer.",1
1,5,so great!,1
1,4,I would really give these 4 1/2 stars.  I wore them all day and they were comfortable.  I am going to order more for my flats.  My only complaints really were it took awhile to receive them and the directions for inserting them could be clearer.  I would and have recommended them to others.,1
1,5,SO great! Exceeds expectations,1
1,5,I tried the flats first and was surprised it was really easy to install and they actually made my flats more comfortable! Happy customer here.,1
1,4,Ok so far,1
1,5,Perfect for all shoes!,1
1,4,Love these! ,1
1,4,"They're good, but I don't care for the pressure on the ends of my toes.
",1
1,4,Love the concept of Gekks! The Closet Pack is great because it allowed me to try a variety of shoe styles with Gekks.,1
1,5,Love these. Highly recommend these to anyone not wanting their shoes to stink and their socks to slip. ,1
1,4,"I really love the ballet flats version, but the one for sneakers has a lot of extra material that folds up in places & makes everything a bit uncomfortable (mostly around the heal). I haven't tried the loafers yet - hopefully they will be more like the fit of the ballet flats.",1
1,4,"They are mostly comfortable. The ballet flat pair doesn't keep my toes in so if you have wider feet like I do, you might want to skip these and use the loafers in their place. I haven't tried that yet so I don't know if that would be comfortable. Installation is pretty easy, but I've noticed for the loafers, one foot is totally comfortable and the other feels like the Gekk is moving around too much. It is probably user error so install carefully.",1
1,4,"A bit of a challenge to ""install"" in my shoes, but once in they are doing the trick! I can't wait to order more!",1
1,4,A little slippery but overall a useful product. Will probably buy more.,1
1,4,"Love the concept -getting the hand of ""installing"" takes a while - how about a Gekks for clogs ?",1
1,5,Terrific solution to socks!!,1
1,5,love them!,1
1,5,I wasn't sure how this was going to work but they were easy to attach and very comfortable!,1
1,5,"I rarely write reviews, but these socks ARE AWESOME!!! Especially for fans of ballerina flats -  these are a must have!",1
1,4,"I really love the product! Getting it to fit and stay in the shoe takes a little bit of practice. However, it's nice to know that my shoes will be protected, and that the gekks themselves are washable! Super cool.",1
1,5,"I love the ballet slipper inserts so much for my Turks, I had to try the closet pack. I put the insert in my slip on canvas shoes and cannot believe how comfortable they are! It's like I'm wearing socks without having to constantly fix the heels! Being a size 12, I worried that the large would not fit, but they feel great!",1
1,5,They work great! So far I've used them for my ballet flats. Have yet to try for the loafers and the sneakers but my loafers are ready to go and I just have to decide which sneakers I want to have them in. These are great if you don't want wear socks.,1
1,5,Great product!,1
1,4,I wish they would stick down everywhere. The loose toe pocket gets scrunched up and can be a pain to get on right. But I like the loafer version and can't wait to try the sneaker size in my booties. ,1
1,5,"They take a little getting used to (almost feels like no show socks that Already slipped, and are only hugging your toes...) but once you get used to it, they are Great! So convenient, so much cleaner feeling",1
1,4,The sneaker and flat Gekks are great.  The loafer Gekks just don't  want to stick to anything.  I've contacted customer service and I'm hope they'll rectify the situation.  I love the Gekks that are sticking in my shoes properly!,1
1,4,I am getting used to them.  They were tricky to put in- I wanted to make sure it was done right.  I think I will order more flats once summer comes around ,1
1,5,"I Love these. From the time of my purchase until they finally arrived almost 1 month later, I was certain this would indicate the quality of the product. I am very happy to report that I was wrong. These have quickly become a nice addition to my life. ",1
1,5,Love geeks,1
1,5,Ive only tried the inserts for the flats so far but they are a game changer! For someone who has struggled with sweating and blisters they made all the difference ,1
1,4,Wonderful!  What a great concept.,1
1,5,Best invention!,1
1,4,Love the convenience. A thinner sock would be make it better!,1
1,5,Love them! Very comfortable and performed just as promised!!,1
1,5,"So far I am LOVING my Gekks. My loafer Gekks have been coming unstuck on the top part of the shoe, but does not affect the function...I only notice it when I take the shoes off. I am very satisfied and want everyone to start using Gekks!!",1
1,5,Closet pack is great to try out all the options.  I like the flats version the best.  The others are good too.,1
1,5,Makes shoes so comfy and no sweat!,1
1,5,Love love love and I'm telling everyone I work with about them. Only downside is that they took so long to ship.,1
1,5,Im obsessed with these!,1
1,4,"I loved the loafer and sneaker styles, but the style for flats didn't work at all for me. The socks were just too narrow, so the seams hit my feet in uncomfortable places. I put them in flats that have a very slight wedge, and the socks made my feet slide forward as I walked, which isn't a problem when I go without socks. It was a bummer because I needed them for flats the most. However, I'll consider buying more sneaker and loafer styles. They protect my heels and never budge no matter how active I am. The best part is that I'm unaware of them for the most part throughout the day, which is just a miracle considering how many pairs of no-show socks I've thrown away out of frustration.",1
1,5,I really like the gekks. The flats ones are my favorite so far. ,1
1,4,They are great so far. I‚Äôd love to see some designed for wearing with pumps. ,1
1,5,Perfect starter kit! But let me tell you! But one pair for every pair of shoes! ,1
1,5,"First time user of Gekks & I think they're fabulous, they do everything you say they will, thank you. I will have to think twice about purchasing more however, as they are quite expensive. As another option, I would love it if there were socks made in this fabric that would be interchangeable with your shoes, that would be great!",1
1,4,"I‚Äôve only had one day to wear my Tieks with the Gekks inserted, but I already love them!  Not once did I feel like they were slipping off, like the nylon liners I‚Äôve tried in the past.  I hope to say the same after several wears.  ",1
1,4,So far I am really enjoying my Gekks. They are a little tricky to install and take some getting used to. But they have made a huge difference for my feet. ,1
1,5,easy to put in shoes.  So far working well! ,1
1,5,Amazing ,1
1,5,Not as difficult to install as some reviewers said,1
1,5,Loving my Gekks! So easy and comfortable!,1
1,4,Like to product gave four stars due to how difficult it was to peel of the backing paper and instructions l felt were a little confusing ,1
1,5,"I ordered the womens closet pack. I know by reading other reviews to make sure I carefully read how to insert them in my shoes, and to not just try without following the steps. Once Inhad then in my 3 pair of shoes I wish I had gotten more packs . I wore my ballet style flats to work the next day. I loved them. ",1
1,5,Perfect solution!,1
1,4,The closet pack is a great way to try the different shoe shapes. The gekks worked well and were very comfy to wear,1
1,4,"Once you attach the permanent bit in your shoes, it is very nice. I attached the ballet flats in one of my high heel pairs and it is working well, except sometimes my heel slips a bit.  I use the loafers inserts in my TOM's and that is working extremely well.",1
1,5,I love My Gekks!!  It‚Äôs everything I thought they‚Äôd be. I struggled with the first set. Then I watched the video. Now I‚Äôm good!  ,1
1,5,Best socks. I didn't believe they would make a difference. I was wrong.,1
1,4,They are nice a bit different than what I expected but I do like them,1
1,5,They stay in place all day and I'm on my feet all day!,1
1,5,Pretty spiffy idea for sweaty feet! I figured out the install process and wore my Toms for a day in comfort! ,1
1,4,Comfortable. Take your time securing them into your shoe for proper fit. ,1
1,5,This is the answer we‚Äôve been waiting for. I don‚Äôt know why it took me so long to order!!!,1
1,5,Love them! ,1
1,5,Work perfect love them!,1
1,5,Work as advertised,1
1,5,They work great in all my shoes and I can't wait to not have smelly feet as it gets hotter out.,1
1,5,These are great!,1
1,5,..........:,1
1,5,I like these slip Ins and they stay in the shoe at all times but you can take them out to wash! ,1
1,4,"I wore my pair of ballet flats all day and they were very comfortable!  Not too difficult to put in my shoes.  Definitely the answer for me, as the heel of any other liner has always slipped off before.",1
1,5,These are the answer to my prayers!!  I have a severe allergy to nylon. This is the perfect alternative!!! Thank you Gekks for giving me back my freedom from socks!!,1
1,5,These are the answer to my prayers!!  I have a severe allergy to nylon. This is the perfect alternative!!! Thank you Gekks for giving me back my freedom from socks!!,1
1,5,Love them so far!,1
1,5,Love them,1
1,5,Made my uncomfortable sneakers comfortable and my feet didn't smell,1
1,4,Great! ,1
1,5,"Sharing advice I got from customer service - I wear a women's 8.5 or 9, and the large was the right size for me, they fit great. I'm putting these in as many shoes as possible! They make wearing shoes without socks so much more comfortable. Installation is a little difficult the first time, but the videos make it easy to figure out. Also, the first time you wear them, you will probably have to adjust a little, but after that, they will be set and comfortable.

One feature that I wish the ballet flats had in particular is a wider coverage of the heel portion of the shoe. These help prevent blisters at the very back of my heel, but my usual problem areas are further to the sides, where the gekks don't cover. 

But overall, very happy and I will be getting more. ",1
1,5,"I was having heel pain with a couple pair of my workout sneakers I put these in and they work great, no pain and no socks.  Love them.",1
1,4,Great,1
1,5,"Loved these- easy to use, comfortable, and they work!",1
1,5,Love this product!  Works much better than shoe liners!,1
1,4,"Love the variety, but wish there was nude color option",1
1,5,I love my Gekks!!! It‚Äôs so nice not having my socks balled up under my arch all day!!,1
1,5,Great!,1
1,5,I wore them for the first time the other day. I love them! ,1
1,5,My first purchase and I‚ÄôM OBSESSED! Seriously give me all the Gekks! ,1
1,5,I couldn't be happier!,1
1,5,"I was nervous to buy these but oh are they wonderful!! A little tricky putting them in the show for the first time, but I didn‚Äôt have to deal with sick slippage once!! ",1
1,5,Love love love this product ,1
1,5,so far loving them!  working as advertised and easy to install in shoes.,1
1,4,"Love the flats but the loafers make my shoes very snug. I wear a half size smaller in flats and loafers. But the top portion of the Gekks loafers is a bit bulky and makes my shoes feel tight. But I really love them in d‚Äôorsay pointy flats. They are so comfortable and no-show. They protect the shoe as well as they do my feet. Will keep the Gekks in the loafers, but may need to reconsider shoe sizes in the future so I can slide a Gekks in there. ",1
1,4,"I like the product. However, the shipping process was ridiculous. I didn't get a shipping confirmation for at least 2+ weeks. I had to contact twice to find out when I would get them. It was almost a month between ordering and receiving. ",1

1,5,"Once I figured out how to install the Gekks, they were a perfect fit for my Aerosoles loafers. I also am now able to wear my flats (stink free) and am looking forward to choosing which pair of sneakers will be lucky enough to be Gekk'd!",1
1,5,Works Great! Love It ,1
1,5,They are great! My shoes don't slip off and my feet don't stick to the bottom of the shoe. Perfect!,1
1,4,"Product wasn't exactly what I was expecting as far as the installation process but I think they do their job pretty well. Really disappointed with how long it took me to received the product, but I'll try Gekks again!",1
1,5,Fantastic! Highly recommend!,1
1,4,"I love them, but ruined one pair in trying to stick them in a shoe. The other 3 are working fine.",1
1,5,Work great and stay put in your shoes,1
1,4,love love love!  help with combat no sock shoe smell and are super comfortable,1
1,5,"I'm totally sold! I love these already. They don't slip off the back of my heal when I walk. They were kind of hard to install but after the first one, I'll be good with the other 2. Will definitely order more.",1
1,4,Love the variety pack I received! I installed the gekks in several pairs of shoes and they work great. Wish they made gekks for mule-type shoes.,1
1,5,It's great!!,1
1,4,"Order your correct size - do not size up!
",1
1,5,Awesome,1
1,4,The Velcro pieces on the heel and the upper part of the shoe don't stay in place when you remove the socks to wash them.  More Velcro squares need to be in the package to care for this problem.,1
1,5,These are the best things I've ever had! Love them! Want them for all my shoes lol,1
1,4,I love these so far! I typically wear an 8.5 and wish I had ordered the large rather than the medium.,1
1,5,I love gekks so much I buy them as gifts!,1
1,4,Fairly easy to install and they were very comfortable! I didn't even feel them unlike those no show socks I used to wear that never stayed put. Will be getting some for my daughter!,1
1,4,"So far so good. They are very comfortable and stay put all day. My only complaint is that I didn't realize that each pair of Gekks requires a liner that sticks in your shoe, and it only comes with one per pair, so you basically have to buy a Gekks liner (the part the sock attaches to) for every pair of shoes that you want to wear them with.",1
1,5,These are beyond comfortable and so nice to have for someone who wears a lot of flats!,1
1,5,"Very cool liners, feel way more comfortable wearing my shoes for longer amount of time",1
1,5,I'm in LOVE with my Gekks! ,1
1,5,Beyond amazing I have already ordered a second set! ,1
1,5,"This an amazing product! I've already worn my Tieks with Gekks, and it was great. Looking forward to using my other styles. Genius!",1
1,5,"They work great!  THANKS!!
",1
1,5,"Really happy with the results!  Comfortable, stays put, and liberating!",1
1,4,"A little awkward to install.  The tongue of the loafer one moves around some.  But after a day at the mall, my feet were dry and stink-free!",1
1,5,Ballet and sneaker gekks have been great.  Haven't used the loafer insert yet but I know I'll love them.  Need to purchase two more ballet flat gekks.  Awesome product. ,1
1,5,These are amazing!! ,1
1,4,"I think they are amazing - But I didn't realize when I ordered them that they need to be installed in a pair of shoes, that I wasn't buying socks I could use with whatever shoes I wanted, but that I was adding at least $15 per pair of shoes essentially because they are inserted into the shoes and stay there. Good product - crazy price model. ",1
1,4,"I really like the functionality of these.  It's easy enough to ""install"" them.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because you have to be super careful removing the Gekks to wash them or you could pull out the Velcro from the shoe.  I think they may need a better adhesive or something.  Or maybe that can't be corrected at all.  Great product though.  ",1
1,4,A little difficult to put in the shoe but they work great.,1
1,5,"Made my Toms even more comfortable, plus I can already tell a difference with keeping my feet less smelly in them. Thanks!",1
1,5,Everyone should have these! I love them.,1
1,4,So far I have only put one pair in a set of shoes ....Love them!  Perfect and comfortable.  I see more in my future.,1
1,4,This is a nice assortment. I like them so far. ,1
1,4,they work just fine...a little hard to understand the directions at first.,1
1,5,"Gekks are great! I put them in my favorite ballet slippers and they are so comfy. I love the ""no socks"" look, but not how my feet feel in hot, sweaty Houston weather!! Gekks to the rescue!!",1
1,5,Love it! One for every kind of shoe,1
1,5,"I love them, so far so good! ",1
1,5,"It took a while for my Gekks to arrive because they are becoming so popular, but now I see why!  Super comfortable and they don't slide around my feet like other no show socks. I highly recommend these!!",1
1,5,Love my Gekks! I've been telling everyone about them! ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
1,5,These are such a genius idea. They are comfortable and easy to install. I'm buying a pair for all my shoes that I normally have to wear no show socks with. The Gekks make wearing all my favorite shoes that much easier. The medium fit perfect for my size 8.5 shoes. ,1
1,5,Great product and deal.,1
1,5,"LOVE these!!!  Wish you made them in kid's sizes!!
",1
1,5,Very comfortable,1
1,5,Love them.  So comfortable.  Would like Gekks to design a pair for clogs.,1
1,5,Love these. I have put in both types and they are working really well. The adhesive is great so far and easy to reposition. ,1
1,4,Love my Gekks! They work perfectly! Only issue was it took a full month to ship my order.,1
1,5,Love them,1
1,5,Love them... Was leary wt first about the ballett pack but they wre my fav! ,1
1,5,Great product!,1
1,5,These are soo comfy!!,1
1,4,so far so good!,1
1,5,The best shoe liners ever!,1
1,4,"I like them - a little tricky to first install, but once you get the hang of it not too tough. The problem is the incredibly long time it takes to get them. You need to either improve your production or fix your distribution  problems. I kept getting coupons to order more and I hadn't received the initial order. I want to order more but figure it will take months for them to come. Do I like them that much for the price???",1
1,4,"I have only used the ones for flats so far, but I like them. They fit the shoes well and were much better than no show socks or going barefoot.",1

1,5,Love them,1
1,5,I think they are wonderfully comfortable easy to use and plan on buying more!,1
1,4,"I've been using these for a little over a week. They are working well so far. I wear a wide shoe, so they are a little bit small, side to side, for me. Not Gekk's fault. I had a small amount of difficulty putting them into my loafers. It was a matter of learning how to do it the right way. Once they were in correctly they have worked easily. I love having them. I get out the door quicker, feel comfortable, find it easier to get in and out of them at the doctor's office, friends' homes, airport, etc. It's a relief. I also like being set free from a whole load of socks each week. Thanks Gekks!",1
1,5,"This is a brilliant solution to a ""problem"" and the closet pack is a perfect combo.",1
1,4,"They work well for controlling shoe scent and fit nicely in the styles they're made for, but the ballet flat cut tends to slip off my size 8 wide foot, so that it just loops around my big toe after an hour or so.",1
1,5,Easy to install and super comfy!!,1
1,5,"they really work!! love them, just hated the delivery delay.",1
1,5,"So far I have tried the GEKKS in a pair of ballet flats. I have to say that I am hugely impressed so far. They were much easier to insert than I ever dreamed they would be and are extremely comfortable to wear. This is coming from two very picky, picky feet that value comfort above all else. Eager to use in other shoes!",1
1,5,"I've struggled finding the perfect footie for my flats.
I Love the Gekks!  I first bought the ballet flat Gekk and loved it so much I needed the Closet Pack.
I will be adding to my collection.
I definitely recommend Gekks!",1
1,5,I love these - I bought my first pair for some Tieks and then decided I needed the closet pack for another pair of Tieks that was threatening to develop a hole in the leather from wear. These kept my flats from squeaking and in great shape. I put the other two pair of my closet pack in a pair of Vans and a pair of Converse and I couldn't be happier. The customer service was amazing too because I needed a nude pair of the flat pair and black for the rest. These are the best. ,1
1,5,Love Gekks. They are everything they claim. ,1
1,5,Love Gekks. They are everything they claim. ,1
1,5,Love Gekks. They are everything they claim. ,1
1,5,Love it!!!! I need to get the Velcro for other shoes so I can wear it with other shoes!,1
1,5,Nice sampling of product.  Took too long to receive.,1
1,4,"These are pretty cool and should help with the stench factor.  A little difficult to place properly in some of my shoes but overall I'm looking forward to wearing them. 
",1
1,5,Love my Geeks! I never wear socks and these are the best alternative to socks. ,1
1,5,"Easy to install, hardest part was getting the nerve to stick in my tieks. So glad I did, these feel great, wish I had these sooner, shipping took longer than I expected. I can't wait to put them in all of my shoes. ",1
1,5,Useful and comfortable so far,1
1,4,I love this product. I do not love that it took 20 days from the day I ordered to the day they shipped. ,1
1,5,"This is a lifesaver for both me and my shoes!! They are a little tricky to put in perfectly, but once you get them in, they change your life! Haha! Stink-free shoes and no more blisters!",1
1,5,Love these!!! Highly recommend! ,1
1,5,They work well!,1
1,5,it is great.,1
1,5,"Forget about those uncomfortable tiny socks that constantly slip under your foot. Gekks are a game changer. Have the soft feeling of socks but without wearing them. It's hard to explain, but you'll understand when you try them ;)",1
1,4,Like them very much,1
1,5,Loved them!,1
1,4,"Although they're not the easiest thing to install, once they're in, they are awesome! I love not having to wear socks in my sneakers, and they have made wearing flats without socks much more pleasurable. Thanks!",1
1,5,I think they are great. ,1
1,5,Very excited to find this awesome alternative to socks!  I love to go without them so am very happy for Gekks!,1
1,4,"I used the Gekks in my sneakers and wore them traveling, going thru the airports and security. I used to have to stop and adjust my socks but I never had to do so with the Gekks. The Gekks stayed put and I was very comfortable with them during the trip. ",1
1,5,Great service! Good product.,1
1,5,"Perfect for summer shoes, I bought the triple pack and have already worn the tennis shoes and ballet flats. They are comfy and give me the barefoot look without the grossness of being barefoot! Will order more!",1
1,5,"I absolutely LOVE these!  They are so easy to put in. They don't slip or bunch up and best of all, my shoes didn't smell AT ALL by the end of the day!  I love the different styles for different shoes. I may never wear socks again!",1
1,4,Every once in awhile one will come out when I remove my foot from the shoe.  But that's minor.  They're comfortable.,1
1,5,really love the whole concept! they all fit great,1
1,4,"I wish they were the nude color, did not realize I ordered black",1
1,5,"big fan-- works great and super comfortable!
",1
1,5,These are great! Literally life changing! I have horrible foot sweat and since putting Gekks in my shoes I can wear my converse without socks and not have to wash my feet when I get home. I love them!,1
1,5,"I love these inserts for my shoes. There is no slipping; there are no worries about socks wrinkling. The velcro sticks very well which is great. However, the velcro was a bit of a hassle when attaching the sock part. I think that is the pay-off for the convenience. You just have to take the time. It is worth it.",1
1,4,"I had a little trouble to get the sticker inserts to fit properly (it stuck to itself as I was apply it to insole), but it's working fine.  Very comfortable, my feet are not sweaty at all, and you cannot see the liners!  Everything I had hoped for.  I will certainly buy more and hopefully will get the hang of how to apply shoe insert stickers.  ",1
1,5,"I love them so far. Easy to install, very comfy! ",1
1,5,"amazing! i've had these one shoes that have killed my feet and i just put Gekks in and for the first time, no socks, no blisters!! Genius! ",1
1,5,Love Gekks!!  I'm telling all my friends about them. ,1
1,5,"Finally, a comfortable way to wear shoes with no socks!  Gekks fit perfectly in my heels, I wore them all day with comfort.  Easy to place into my shoes and they did not affect the fit of my shoe. Great product!",1
1,5,"Bought for my mom as a gift, she loves them, will be ordering some for myself!",1
1,5,So convenient!  I can just slip my feet into my shoes and go! Comfort all day long!,1
1,5,Perfect,1
1,5,"Love these. I have always loved the sockless
look but hated having no socks. These work great. I just finished a weeks vacation with the loafer pair and was walking constantly and no stinky feet, no blister. 
I plan to put in all my sockless shoes",1
1,5,They are great! Super convenient and easy to insert. Great product!,1
1,4,So far so good though I may like it even more if the material is just a tad bit thinner. ,1
1,5,These socks are amazing! Thanks for a great product!,1
1,4,I really like the show socks. Once you get your foot into the sock they are really comfortable. Shipping is very slow 2 to 3 weeks from ordering ,1
1,5,"This is my first time ordering Gekks.  I went with the closet pack as I wanted to see how they fit in different types of shoes.  I put my first pair into a pair of troublesome sneakers (some rubbing in the heel area) and found the shoes were much more comfortable with the Gekks inside.  I look forward to trying out the other pairs!

When the ‚ÄúMake your own closet pack‚Äù came out, I ordered 3 pairs of sneaker Gekks and am anxiously awaiting their arrival.  

Please offer the ‚ÄúMake your own closet pack‚Äù on a regular basis as it gives the customer the option to choose the kind of Gekks he/she needs at a discount, rather than waiting for another ‚Äúmake your own closet pack‚Äù to be offered again.    

",1
1,5,"While shipping had some hiccups, the actual product itself was great, and really work well in my shoes. They're super comfortable and I have not gotten blisters since!",1
1,5,Love them ,1
1,5,"love them, have them in all my flats. I'm not a shoe without sock wearer, so gekks are perfect for me!",1
1,5,Love!!!,1
1,5,Love these inserts for my shoes. First time ever to wear new shoes without getting a blister. Recommend them to anyone looking for this comfort. ,1
1,5,Love my Gekks!  I recently received my order but found the shipment was short one pair.  I contacted the customer service representative and she took care of it immediately.  Overall a great product and customer service.  I would recommend this product.,1
1,5,Haven‚Äôt tried them yet,1
1,4,Not too bad......a little tricky to install in coverage but not too bad,1
1,5,LOVE that I don't have to tug at these like I had to with my no-show socks!!  Gekks actually make some of my shoes fit more comfortably.,1
1,5,"LOVING these!!!  I haven‚Äôt tried the loafer sock yet.  But, the sneaker pair and flats pair are wonderful!!!  They make comfortable shoes amazingly comfortable and they fix shoes that rub on the ankle‚Äîmaking them comfortable.  I highly recommend them!",1
1,5,"I LOVE my gekks! I wish there was an option to get a make your own closet pack. I am so happy I got these,  I want to put some in every pair of shoes I own! ",1
1,5,I loved my closet pack.  Now I just need to order more.  Well worth the price.,1
1,5,"Love these socks. Would love them even more if you did special closet packs that were all of one type...like 3 or for sneakers; 3 or for flats, etc...",1
1,4,"I love the concept, but am having trouble applying the socks correctly.  I may have ruined one pair due the way the sticky part pulled the lining on my shoe off.  I'm positive it is something that I am doing wrong and not the sock itself.",1
1,5,Great product and comfortable too!,1
1,5,Love the shoe inserts!  So easy so comfortable can barely tell they are there!,1
1,5,"I‚Äôm very impressed. I hate wearing shoes without socks, and these guys are the perfect solution!",1
1,5,"These inserts are great! Hidden from view, comfort for your feet.",1
1,5,love them! just wish I could afford more!,1
1,5,Brilliant ,1
1,5,LOVE them!  Can‚Äôt wait to get them I‚Äôm all of my shoes!  ,1
1,5,This has completely changed my shoe game!,1
1,5,"Clever, interesting design. Wish they weren‚Äôt so pricey. ",1
1,5,When I first opened the package I thought ‚Äúthis will never work‚Äù...but they do!  Wish they were a little less expensive‚ÄîI‚Äôd put them in all my shoes.,1
1,5,"Comfortable and most importantly, stays in place! ",1
1,5,"So far so good, actually great!  Love my Gekks.  They fit perfectly in my shoes and do not budge while wearing them.  I recently ordered more but did not do another closet pack because you added Gekks for heels to that set. Wish you had kept the original closet pack and then added a closet pack with the heels as a second option.  Other than that small disappointment the product itself is fantastic.",1
1,5,Love them!,1
1,5,"I like them.  Feel good in my shoes and feet.
",1
1,5,Exactly what I have been looking for. They even keep my feet warmer than I expected! ,1
1,4,Love the Gekks for flats!,1
1,5,Redsign of the insert makes it super easy to use! And the Closet pack has everything I needed!,1
1,5,love it!!,1
1,4,Pretty cool! Adds enough coverage to be comfortable but not enough to make the shoe fit tighter! ,1
1,5,"I like my Gekks a lot. They seem to work better in my sneakers, than in my ballet flats, though. I still give 5 stars because they do exactly what they're supposed to do. ",1
1,4,"They are great! Easy to install, easy to wear!",1
1,5,I tried the sneakers and just loved them. They were so comfortable. Can't wait to try the others.,1
1,5,Love being able to slip my feet in and go! The instructions are easy to understand and I like the fabric. I can't wait to order some more for the rest of my shoes,1

1,5,These are awesome!  ,1
1,5,A friend introduced me to Gekks and I'm so glad she did! The closet pack gave me the opportunity to put my Gekks in three different types of shoes. I love them so much that I've ordered two more loafers and another sneaker. ,1
1,5,I love them! Easy to insert and comfortable all day long.,1
1,4,"My ballet flats liners wouldn't stick to the inside of my shoes. I've ordered new ones, but meanwhile, my shoes are not usable.  The other two sets worked well! I'm happy!",1
1,5,these work amazing!!,1
1,4,Am not disappointed!  Will be looking to purchase more soon!  ,1
1,5,Just what I needed,1
1,5,"Exactly what I was hoping for, and very comfortable!",1
1,5,"I have only ben using 1 of the 3 styles thus far and I LOVE them.  I can't wait to try the others.  The only problem is I can't decide which shoes deserve to have!  I rarely wear socks so I wish I could have them in ALL OF MY SHOES!  Also, you should make a ""toes only"" version for sling back shoes and mules.  And additional discounts for buying in bulk  I want them in all my clogs, 2-3 pairs of sling back summer shoes, 4 pairs of ballet flats, the list could go on and on.  Thanks Gekks.  ",1
1,5,Great product! I wish they were cheaper so i can have them in all of my summer shoes!,1
1,5,Great product! I wish they were cheaper so i can have them in all of my summer shoes!,1

1,5,"Love it. Easy to put in the shoes and the sock doesn't move around at all, but comes off easily when you want. ",1
1,5,Very easy to use and quite comfy!!,1
1,4,Section that attaches to the shoe should be more adhesive ,1

I'm ready to order a set for all my shoes.  ",1
1,4,"shipping is excruciatingly slow, but gekks are worth the wait!",1
1,5,Perfect!,1
1,5,"Fantastic replacement for no show socks. I have these in toms, ballet flats and converse all stars. My feet stink. And they don't anymore. If only I'd had these in high school!!",1
1,5,So far so good. I will post another review late. ,1
1,5,So far these have worked like a dream!  No stink from my favorite sneakers!  It's a miracle!,1
1,5,I hate to wear shoes without my Gekks inside ,1
1,5,"So far, I have used the Gekks for flats.  Used them at a convention where I was on my feet and walking several miles a day.  NO BLISTERS!!!!",1
1,4,I wish it included more of the ballet flat style.,1
1,5,I love them. But the long delivery time leaves a little to be desired ,1
1,5,MAGIC!!!! I can't believe how well these work!,1
1,5,These are the best!  I wish I had found them before I reunited so many pairs of ballet flats. I want them in every pair of shoes! ,1
1,5,LOVE all 3 pairs of Gekks!,1
1,5, Works great   ,1
1,5,They are a great alternative to socks,1
1,5,"Not going to lie, i was extremely skeptical of these..... i was AMAZED when i took my shoes off. No smell. At all. I even forced several people to smell my feet! haha....And then I went back and ordered several more pairs of grippers. I never want to wear shoes without these ",1
1,5,Just love them. ‚ù§ great quality affordable price. ,1
1,5,They were easy to install. ,1
1,4,I think it was a good deal to be able to try the different products that way. ,1
1,5,"I have had the Gekks inyou shoes for over a week and they have been great! No smell, no sweat, and very comfotable. Just like a sock, but without the issues of the sock falling/sliding down on the shoe. I'm about to order another pair now! ",1
1,5,Now to get theses for all my shoes.... AWESOME!,1
1,5,"Gekks are amazing!! I just purchased the closet pack, and I've installed the ballet liners in my flats. It took a little effort to get them in correctly, but it was entirely worth it.  They fit great. Not too bulky. They are super soft. The adhesive on the gripper is strong as is the gripper which attaches to the soft material liner.  I wish I would have known about these sooner! ",1
1,5,Great. The Gekks are just what I needed for my shoes. Have recommended them to other family and friends.,1
1,5,The closet pack is an awesome way to try all the ways hella work.  Would definitely buy another set.,1
1,5,great,1
1,4,easy to install. comfortable to wear. so far so good!!,1
1,5,Wife loves them,1
1,4,"I love the concept and love that my feet don't smell after going ""sockless"". Once the Gekks are in place, the don't move, unlike other no show socks. However, I've found that the gripper on the sock portion is starting to come away from the sock already. Only worn 3 times. It hasn't come off, but I'm being ultra careful so that it doesn't. ",1
1,5,Bought the pack as a gift for my daughter and she loves them!,1
1,5,Great product. ,1
1,5,I love Gekks! Solves many shoe and ped problems PLUS foot sweat! ,1

1,5,So excited for my daughter &I to use these,1
1,5,This is a really good deal,1
1,5, Absolutely wonderful. Great company to work with! I had an issue and they rectified it immediately !!!  ,1
1,5,Love these. No more slipping down and pulling footies up all the time. ,1
1,4,The grippers were a little difficult to insert. But once they were in,1
1,4,thanks!,1
1,4,"Seem to stay in place really well. Nice not to
Have to search for socks. ",1
1,5,One of the best products I have purchased in quite a while!,1
1,5,Never thought that gekks work... I'm happy using them!!! ,1
1,5,Love!,1
1,5,These are so great! I have tried EVERY brand of low socks and they all fall down and annoy me. Gekks are comfortable and stay up beautifully! Now my shoes wont get disgusting with my bare feet in them!,1
1,5,Great,1
1,5,I love them!!!,1
1,5,I love these! Having the variety is great - each is specialized for each type of show to ensure they stay out and don't interfere with the comfort of the shoe. I am the type of person who hates bunchy socks at my toes or a teeny tiny pebble drives me nuts. These didn't bother me at all and actually made the shoes even more comfy.,1
1,4,"So far so good!  Not 5 stars only because I don't wear ballet flats, or anything that style would fit, so I have a wasted pair.  But I for sure love the loafer and sneaker style.  They are versatile and will fit in other style shoes, like my ankle booties!  I will definitely buy more!  ",1

1,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!",1
1,5,"It was great, but took forever to actually get to me. ",1
1,4,These are just terrific- I need several more for ballet flats now and would really like to purchase some additional bases.,1
1,5,I bought these right before a trip to Morocco and installed a pair into my Toms straight away. I wore them all day walking through the souks and even during an excursion to the Sahara. The Gekks stay put the entire time and eliminated the need for socks altogether. They were comfortable and worked like a charm even when my shoes kept filling with sand in the desert. Great product!,1

1,5,Very comfy especially in my converse tennis shoes.  ,1
4,5,<Loved my first two pairs of Gekks! Gonna get some more!,4
4,4,"These are really different and take a few to get used to but wow they are comfortable. You just slip your foot in and BAM. It's cool too cuz they fit perfectly and dont ride up and it's a very neat product. If I had one complaint, it's on me not the item. As a clean freak, I feel the need to wash them like socks but they dont have any odor and they arent dirty.  Like i said, it's different.  Try them. Very cool product. ",4
4,5,Great!,4
4,5,Love these,4
4,4,took a bit to get the tongue gripper set just right but working great now. ,4
4,4,hard to get use to no wearing socks with sneakers,4
4,5,"Better than barefoot, better than any socks. The perfect solution!",4
4,5,Luv new design over the old gel style,4
4,5,Love them! I love how they are easy to put inside the shoes and can wear comfortably throughout the day. ,4
4,5,Awesome! I need to buy more for all my other shoes! ,4
4,5,Makes my shoes really comfortable with no socks,4
4,5,great product,4
4,5,"Work exactly as described.  Comfortable, no smell. So nice not to have to worry about socks gathering under your foot!",4
4,4,"Overall pretty great. They were semi difficult to install. My feet get a little sweaty in them as if I weren't wearing socks at all, but no funk like when you wear shoes without socks. ",4
4,5,Love Love Love them! Best things ever! ,4
4,5,easy to use ,4
4,5,"love ..I‚Äôve bought several
",4
4,4,I bought my husband a pair for Christmas and he is already wanting more!,4
4,5,Great product. Easy to use and they really work,4
4,5,Awesome.. bye bye socks.üòÅ,4
4,4,"Don't know yet, it turned cold right after I received them so I probably won't try them until spring. ",4
4,5,Great once I got them into my loafers. Can't wait to give them for Xmas,4
4,5,Love these!!!,4
4,4,"Had a little trouble at first placing the first liner. Had to walk away from it for a day. But after giving it another go, it went smoothly and they are wonderful! 
One of the liners didn't have one of the sticky/Velcro pieces for the tongue of the shoe, but so far it's worked without it. But, found it strange that it was missing. ",4
4,4,They were very comfortable,4
4,4,Gekks work!,4
4,4,Well made. I have a feeling the heel won't stick forever but it hasn't failed yet,4
4,4,Gekks are a very chill alternative to stinking up your favorite sneakers. Turns any shoe into a feet friendly top-sider. My only problem is they are difficult to get in and the instructions are not entirely clear. However once you get them in they're great.,4
4,5,Purchased these primarily for use on vans shoes. They work great! Walked in them an entire day and didn't feel any discomfort. Socks stayed in place the entire time. Will be ordering more soon!,4
4,5,Everything as advertised,4
4,5,"Was a little difficult to fit in my workout shoes because the grippers are so sticky, but once I had them in and put them on will definitely get some more. thanks",4
4,5,"This product is amazing! I bought 1 pair for some low cut shoes I have to try them out. They are more comfortable than socks, and free me from the pain of always losing all my no show socks. I am ordering 2 more pairs for my wife and I ASAP!",4
4,5,"Very easy to install and they work amazingly well. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to get the no sock look, while keeping the comfort and dryness of socks.",4
4,5,Love them!! Will be buying more!!,4
4,5,"Love, love, love... my Gekks. Easy to use and work as promised and I have some of the sweatiest and stinkiest kickers around. Til now it was impossible for me to go without socks. Then Gekks came into my life and I am free of socks. Thanks a ton.",4
4,5,Best new product to come out in the market in years ...Put them in your shoes no more socks no more stank... Amazing,4
4,5,"Gekks are awesome! I doubted the grippers, at first, when sticking them on into my Nike Flyknit Lunar 3s. They stuck like a charm! After that putting in the Gekks, I love how I can easily slip my foot in and out! Thanks, Gekks!",4
4,5,Great,4
4,5,These things are amazing!!! Literally ordering a stack more for most of my workout shoes and vans. Love them!!!!,4
4,5,Fit great.,4
4,5,The new design provides an awesome fit & total comfort!,4
4,5,"I always liked going sockless but never do because of sweat and comfort. Now I can, thanks to Gekks!!",4
4,5,have been using gekks for a few weeks and they've been great so far. super comfortable and no smell. haven't washed the liner yet either.,4
4,5,Very satisfied with my Gekks. So easy to install and very comfortable.,4
4,5,"I have never worn socks with my Vans because I hate the feeling and they always slide down on my feet. Gekks not only stay in place, but virtually disappear on your feet. I definitely recommend them.",4
3,4,"The slip-ons work like a charm, but the loafers did alter the fit of my shoe a bit. It may be the shoe, so I am open to trying them with a different pair of shoes. Overall, these are amazing!",3
3,5,Company was very nice when I didn‚Äôt receive my order. They reshipped it and I got it the next week. Interesting innovative footwear!,3
3,4,Love them! The heel of one side fell down pretty quickly but was a pretty easy fix ,3
3,5,They are exactly as described. It's a great alternative to wearing either a traditional sick or no socks at all. ,3
3,4,"Overall, I love them.  I wish the toe stuck down, and the tongue doesn‚Äôt stay stuck, but overall i‚Äôm Very happy.  ",3
3,5,They work great and very easy to install in the shoe!,3
3,5,"Easy to install, comfortable and no slipping!",3
3,5,"These are so fabulous! I wear the in my heels too, best invention EVER",3
3,5,"Love the fit, love how they feel!",3
3,5,"These things are awesome. I primarily bought them to protect my Tieks, and will definitely be buying more.  Very comfortable and easy to put in place. ",3
3,5,They fit nicely and are comfortable!,3
3,5,This is my second time purchasing Gekks.,3
3,5,Works great.,3
3,5,Wasn‚Äôt sure this was going to work but once I got it in and tried it I was surprisingly impressed by how well it worked. Super comfy and easy to put in. It didn‚Äôt slip out of place or bunched up at all. Let a see how well it holds up after some more use. ,3
3,5,"I finally can stop constantly pulling up my no-show socks! I even changed shoes with the slip-ons, and the hand sanitizer trick works perfectly! I was in a rainstorm with the slip-ons, and even though my feet were soaked, the Gekks didn't unstick themselves. I am happy and will buy more! I'm curious as to how well the sneaker Gekks work.",3
3,5,Great product.  I highly recommend them.  They stay put unlike no show socks and make your shoes comfortable.  Buy them!,3
3,5,They are great so far. No complaints!,3
3,5,l love these!,3
3,5,Good,3
3,5,Fantastic fit and comfort! ,3
3,5,Great product...worked as described & as expected. I would order again. They came quickly too!,3
3,4,"A bit of a pain to insert, but comfortable.  Hate the green border, as it doesn't blend well with ANY shoes, ever.  I get the need to stylize, but why green?!  I would prefer a border that is less obvious.",3
3,4,These seem to be holding up well.  My feet are comfortable when wearing them.,3
3,5,love them,3
3,5,Love the feel. Not worried about stains and odour anymore!,3
3,5,"I am enjoying them!
",3
3,5,"Love the quality & the fitting. Curious to see if the stickiness holds up after the wash but other than that, love it so far! ",3
3,5,"I absolutely LOVE them!! I wish I could get a pair for every one of my shoes! I suffer from friction blisters, so I can‚Äôt wear shoes without socks, especially in the summer. Unfortunately, all the ankle socks I buy rid down or dig into my ankles, so I opted for athletes foot spray and deodorant to avoid the blisters, but this causes my skin to dry and crack. Now, my feet are side and pedicured, and I can wear loafers again!! Buy them! You Won‚Äôt regret it. ",3
3,5,They work well and fit perfectly. Would definitely buy again. 10/10 would recommend,3
3,4,"I love how these work, fresh smelling shoes without socks! ",3
3,4,Super comfortable. I love that I can just slip them on and not worry about socks for my spring/summer shoes at work. ,3
3,4,The adhesive comes off a little bit but other than that I love them!,3
3,5,"These are amazing! I‚Äôve only worn them once so far, but they worked perfectly",3
3,5,I love my favourite shoes even more now,3
3,5,"These are great!  
",3
3,5,Perfect,3
3,5,Love it!,3
3,5,I wore it on a long haul flight and walking across airport terminals was so easy and comfy. I did not have to worry about blisters with new loafers and also no smelly feet!! I wish you had them for peep too shoes also. ,3
3,5,Gekks has been the answer to my prayers of no more footies slipping off my heels,3
3,4,"My slip-on shoes sit a little lower on the top than the standard loafer, so the top flange did not work as designed, but I was able to fold that top flange back on itself as a work around. Much better than going sockless. ",3
3,5,I love them! It was easy to install into my shoe and its so nice having my socks inside my shoes and ready to go! In addition to the socks never slipping down!,3
3,4,Overall they're great so far. There's one spot that rubs a little because the gekks don't reach far enough to protect that area.,3
3,4,"Fit my Sperry loafers well. They don‚Äôt have Velcro like the pair I bought for my flats, so I‚Äôm unsure how they will hold up after a washing. ",3
3,5,"Love these!  They do everything they claim to do.  Plus, they make shoes fit better, more comfortable, no odor.  I eventually will have them in all my shoes.  So worth every penny!",3
3,4,"So far, so good. ",3
3,5,"So far, I love them. I wore them all day yesterday touring Williamsburg, and I couldn‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt stink when I took my shoes off! I have sweaty feet, so THAT is worth the price. I will be ordering some more for a couple of other pairs of shoes!",3
3,5,"These were put on a pair of comfy, old (and truly stinky) leather loafers that I couldn't give up! I do smell a small level of stink from the already semi-destroyed leather (unavoidable), but I've had NO MORE stinky feet and the smell never gets worse like it used to! These are truly great. Now I only wish I had an idea of how long I can safely go without washing them....",3

3,5,"I love them!  I like the improved style that doesn't require the ""anchor system"" in the shoe.  Much easier to use.",3
3,5,I like. ,3
3,5,"I love Gekks. After struggling for years to find socks that are comfortablle and fit correctly, this is the solution. I love that they actually seem to breath. Gekks has a new forever-customer. ",3
3,5,They work like you said!,3
3,5,"I LOVE my Gekks!! Now I need them for all my flats and slip on sneakers!! They are wonderful. My shoes are more comfortable with them inside, and my feet are not stinky or sticky inside!",3
3,5,They are great and fit so well.  They don't slip at all.,3
3,5,These are finally the answer to ‚Äúno socks‚Äù! I love them and have been recommending Gekks to all my friends. ,3
3,4,I love them so far!,3
3,5,They work better than I thought they would!,3
3,5,"I really like this product planning on buying more , easy to use.. Fit my loafers perfect, love just slipping on without worrying about socks .",3
3,5,I love it,3
3,4,"I like these now that in my shoes, but it‚Äôs defintely an art to getting Gs into shoes. They‚Äôre great once in and are comfy and haven‚Äôt slipped. Definitely would recommend.",3
3,5,They are great!!,3
3,4,This is my second order. I have to say I like the  concept of my first order better as it had the Velcro like attachment. I can‚Äôt see how the adhesive is going to allow me to take off and wash them out back on. ,3
3,5,"Great fit & comfort!  Wonderful customer service as well. I had purchased a closet pack, but hadn‚Äôt used the loader set when I received it. Later when I went to insert them one of the socks was missing 2 of the adhesive spots. I contact customer service via email with a quick response they mailed a new pair at no expense to me. I have since used them and they fit perfectly. They are also so soft. Curious to see how they hold up after washing. ",3

3,5,Love them.  They stay in place in your shoes and no more having to fix your socks all day long.  ,3
3,5,"I am absolutely THRILLED with my new Gekks! I no longer have to deal with wearing shoes with ""no-show"" socks or footies that slide and bunch up. The Gekks are comfortable, keep my feet dry, and I have no odor build-up. They are easy to insert and true to size. I will buy again!",3
3,5,Nice,3
3,5,I love these! Make it so easy to slip my shoes on and go! ,3
3,4,Once they were in I like them however they are a little big for my shoes and stick up above the back a bit which is unfortunate. They were also hard to get in and I wound up having to peel off a layer of adhesive during the process because it lost the sticky and none of the recovery methods worked. Overall I would get them again but I wish that the adhesive came back like they claim with hand sanitizer or soapy water. ,3
3,5,I love my Gekks! I have ordered them for many different shoes. Time to order more!,3
3,4,Love them however one of the backs didn‚Äôt stick tok good. ,3
3,5,"I love my gekks! It took a minute for me to get them in correctly but once I did, they didn't move! I will definitely be purchasing more! ",3
3,5,"I've had ALS for 16yrs, I purchased gekks to make my life easier. I love them! ",3
3,5,These are the best thing ever to happen to shoes.,3
3,4,I like  how they stay in the shoe and they don‚Äôt smell just like advertised. ,3
3,5,great,3
3,5,I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would really like these- or if they would really work. I was pleasantly surprised! They have stayed well in my shoes and work perfectly. I struggled with no shoe socks slipping off my heels and did not like not wearing socks so this is a great solution. ,3
3,5,"I was skeptical, but these really are amazing!",3
3,5,Great product,3
3,5,I LOVE these so far.No socks slipping off my foot.,3
3,5,Great for what I needed ,3
3,5,I love the socks!  They wash and dry really well and stick to the insides of my shoes beautifully!,3
3,4,"I may have bought a size too small. They make your shoe fit a little bit tighter. Not much. I haven‚Äôt worn them much, yet. ",3
3,5,I‚Äôve never found a no-show sock I like until these! Magic!,3
3,5,I‚Äôve never found a no-show sock I like until these! Magic!,3

3,5,So comfortable!,3
3,5,They work well and easy to install in my shoes,3
3,5,wonderful ,3
3,4,"They make my shoes so much more comfortable!  They don't make a huge difference in odor control, but it is kept to a minimum.  I'm a little worried about them sticking again after a wash, but I'll give it a try.",3
3,5,gekks has forever changed my shoe wearing experience. No more of those tiny socks that get eaten by the washing machine every other cycle! #gekkgirl,3
3,5,I‚Äôve worn the ballet flat Gekks for a long time. This is my first pair of loafers. I am happy with them  ,3
3,4,I love love love these sock liners!  No more blisters or smelly shoes. And no more constant pulling up of slipping down socks. Thank you Gekks!!!,3
3,4,"I love how my feet stay warm in my Toms with gekks. I'm not sure about how they are supposed to stay sticky for the top part, however.",3
3,4,A little difficult to put in the shoes but once in they are as advertised.,3
3,5,They really stay!!!! Also very comfortable and stretchy for wide and swollen feet (I struggle with edema). Even worked with keeping smell out in memory foam man made shoes which typically make my feet smell.,3

3,5,These things are truly awesome! I've put them in a flat and a loafer and am very pleased with the fit and comfort. Good job Gekks!,3
3,5,I love these so much!! I can't believe you can re-attach them to the shoes after being washed too!,3
3,5,They are the perfect fit for my slip-ones. ,3
3,5,Fit in my shoes perfectly and finally no show.,3
3,5,Work great and are very comfortable! ,3
3,5,"Excellent product. Purchased a pair to put in my Toms because if worn without socks they quickly develop quite an odor but wearing regular low-profile socks means you spend all day stopping mid-step to fix the socks after they slip off your heel. The gekks were super easy to place in my shoes, are virtually invisibly from the outside and most importantly have made it possible for me to wear Toms all day comfortably without any hint of odor when they come off. Will definitely buy more.",3
3,5,A life saver for someone who can't stand slipping socks!,3
3,4,No slipping off! Yay!!!,3
3,4,No slipping off! Yay!!!,3
3,5,Amazing! ,3
3,5,Fit nicely in my Toms!,3
3,5,My smelly foot boyfriend and I are really impressed and happy with Gekks!,3
3,5,Love them üíó will recommend to all my friends!,3
3,5,"I like these alot. Way way better than trying to wear the no show ballet flat type socks from the store, which never stay in place even with rubber heel grips and fashion tape, and rarely ever fit my size 11 wide feet. These work great for my Alegria pro shoes for days that I don't want to wear compression socks. The only thing I would suggest adding to them is making them available in a thicker more cushiony style,  offering a wider size version, and including standard laundering Velcro patches/sheets to cover the Velcro while laundering so it doesn't stick to the sock itself (which would increase the socks lifespan.)",3

3,4,"The socks themselves are great, but docking a star because the adhesive was near impossible to separate. My last three pairs were not nearly this hard. They must have change manufacturers. Good luck securing these into your shoes if you don‚Äôt have nails. ",3
3,4,They take a bit to break in but then they become part of the shoe.  Stopped the squeaking problem I was having. ,3
3,4,"I like the loafers better than the ballet flat ones. Maybe because I'm used to wearing socks in my loafers and not in my ballet flats. I bought the gekks for my ballet flats because I want to protect my feet and shoes from smell and so far, I'm very impressed.",3
3,5,"I love  the loafer Gekks. I hated to have to wear socks or liners in my loafers. The slip-ones are perfect. No fuss, no slipping like other liners and sock I have worn. Very satisfied.",3
3,5,Love them - took a bit of time to get use to but now feel really comfortable. have to wait to see if they live up to their odour eating claims!,3
3,5,"Love Gekks! I typically get blisters or rubbed toes when I don‚Äôt wear socks with my shoes, but with Gekks, I can walk for hours without a rubbing or blister anywhere! I‚Äôll be buying more soon.",3
3,5,These are awesome! They do take a little time to get the perfect fit and you may have to cut the Grippers to fit your shoe perfectly but I they‚Äôre well worth it! I love them! I use them in Toms and no more smell!,3
3,5,"These work great and are very easy to install.  I hardly notice they are in my shoe and I have all the benefits of wearing socks, without having to wear socks.   Very pleased!",3
3,5,"These work great and are very easy to install.  I hardly notice they are in my shoe and I have all the benefits of wearing socks, without having to wear socks.   Very pleased!",3
3,5,"the perfect solution, no more sock liners ending up in a bunch in the toe of my shoe.",3
3,5,"These socks are the perfect solution for my loafers. I have tried many different socks that I hoped would work. Everyone of them would still slip down to my heels, very annoying! I know longer have this problem with these sock inserts.",3
3,5,They're so great! No more sweaty feet!,3
3,5,Fantastic!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüëçüëç,3
3,5,Love!  Gekks solve all of my no show sock problems.,3
3,5,love these!  i don't need to deal w/ my socks showing or slipping anymore!!!!,3
3,4,These feel nice. Nice and soft. Feet don‚Äôt get sweaty. No blisters. They don‚Äôt slide down like socks. ,3
3,5,These make my new loafers so much easier to wear. I'm glad that I gave them a try. Now I'd like them for all of my shoes!,3
3,4,Overall I am really happy with these.  I had no issues with putting them in (really quite easy) and they do exactly what is described.  My one minor problem is this:  I asked what I should buy for a wedge style shoe and was told to buy the sneaker/loafer version. The only problem is (and I should have mentioned this and also should have been more observant) The front of the shoe is actually styled more like a ballet flat so I should have purchased that style.  I‚Äôve made what I bought work but will be ordering a different style next time.,3
3,4,Honestly I didn‚Äôt realize it was going to be attached to my shoe. It is not that easy to ‚Äúinstall‚Äù into your shoe but once accomplished it does work well. It can be removed for washing. I will be curious to see how they wear. It took over 3 weeks for my order to arrive and the boat shoes I bought them specially to wear with will likely not get much wear now that the weather has turned cold.,3
3,4,"I loved the design and the soft feel of the leather.  However, the soft heel had no support and did not feel as stable as expected",3
3,4,"I like then the double face tape doesn't hold well in place. And a bit extra material in toe. Probably because I am a 9 and just at the start of a size change. Probably need a geek to fit sz 8 to 10 so the fit would be better 

",3
3,5,They were just what I needed!,3
3,4,I impressed with my first paid of gekks! I've been eyeing them for a while and finally took the plunge to buy them and so far so good. One gripper became unsticky immediately which was a bit of a disappointment but partly my fault because my shoe was too tight to get it in and when I finally got it in it was wrong so I had to redo it but unfortunately the sticking stuff was gone. :( but my first week with them has been pleasant. Will buy more! ,3
3,4,I was so excited about my gekks but they did not work for my shoes. I use an orthotic due to running injuries and that may have been the problem. The product is high quality and installation was simple after reading the instructions. I absolutely love the concept and highly recommend. ,3
3,4,"The bumper on the heel doesn't seem sticky enough to be secure. But with caution putting on my loafers , they hold up well enough! ",3
3,4,Works great to make my feet feel less sweaty and stinky. Only concern is the durability of the adhesive - only one day in and it's peeling at one of the corners!,3
3,5,Clever.... And Comfortable!,3
3,5,"These were a gift to my daughter, and she loves them!",3
3,5,"A little difficult to insert into shoes on the first try, but they work well! Would definitely buy again.",3
3,5,"tried both and am very pleased..
",3
3,5,Finally! Socks I can wear with Toms! ,3
3,5,"I bought two pairs of gekks, for two pairs of loafers. The gekks work well for both pairs of shoes. At first, I wasn't sure about sticking the adhesive paper in my shoes and attaching the gekks, but the system works beautifully. I am no longer fixing my wadded-up no-show socks, which really bugged me. Truly, I forget that I have on the gekks. I also look stylin' (for an old lady), with that no-socks look. ",3
3,5,"Worst of the batch. Way too hard to affix, tongue doesn't state in place. ",3
3,5,Awesome! Very effective. ,3
3,4,Works great. Only complaint is that I have already worn holes in the toe of one pair. I wear a women's size 10 and bought the large. ,3
3,5,"Love these! They work great, don't slip, and my shoes don't stink! ",3
3,5,"At first, I had my doubts because of the way to put them on the grippy sticker, I thought it wasn't going to work so I don't know I was doubtful but then once I try them on I was surprised how well kept on and make my feet comfortable.",3
3,5,"At first, I had my doubts because of the way to put them on the grippy sticker, I thought it wasn't going to work so I don't know I was doubtful but then once I try them on I was surprised how well kept on and make my feet comfortable.",3

3,5,Exactly as advertized,3
3,5,They were great! They fit very good and made the shoe much more comfortable ,3
3,5,"This was my first time to try gekks and I have already ordered more! I can't believe how comfortable and easy to wear they are!  It's like not wearing socks at all!
",3
3,5,Great solution for slipping footies!!!,3
3,4,"These gave me giant blisters on my heels the first day I used them,  but after the blisters healed I have been able to wear the Gekks liners with no issues. Not a great start but much better now!",3
3,5,They are really great!!,3
3,4,I can only submit a good review. Why is that???,3
3,5,These are my favorite. I wear loafer type shoes all the time. ,3
3,5,Love these. Feel so good on my feet and no stinky shoes now. ,3
3,4,"Good product ... not quite as easy to use as I expected, but they function well once they are inserted.",3
3,5,i think the product was great. ,3
3,4,"I like Gekks.  They are a good alternative to the no-show socks that either show anyway, or don't stay on my feet.  Since they attach to the inside of your shoe, where the sock goes is customizable.  They are also pretty good at staying clean, but I do need to wash them every couple of wears, especially if they are inside my leather shoes that don't breathe much, a little more frequently than I expected.  The other thing is that the heel sticker doesn't like to stick much to canvas inners - it would be nice to have a stronger adhesive for canvas or include a few extra heel grippers instead of me having to order them and pay for shipping.  I'd also like to be able to order additional sole grippers instead of only being able to get them with a full sock set.  Overall, though, this is a good solution to the woes of no-show socks and I've recommended them to friends.  ",3
3,5,"I absolutely love my Gekks. They are worth every penny, stay in place and my feet don't stink at the end of the day ",3
3,5,this is my 2nd gekks purchase. works great to keep my feet dry and combat stinky shoes. love them. ,3
3,4,"material is comfortable, a little difficulty re-inserting/adjusting to get better fit inside shoe, unfortunately foot odor still present--even after washing the inserts.",3
3,5,These are the solution to the problem socks that constantly slide down (or off) inside your shoes! I used the loafer Gekks in my Sanuks and it's perfect!,3
3,5,Love them! I never have to search for no show socks and they keep my feet from rubbing in my shoes. ,3
3,5,"They're super comfortable and stay in your shoe, love them",3
3,5,"I bought them for my husband and he loves them!  Of course I had to ""install"" them. ",3
3,5,Excellent! I hate being barefoot in closed shoes so these work great. The only request or suggestion I have is that you make the sneaker gekk in white and/or nude.,3
3,5,Really liked Gekks. I was looking for something like these. I where my loafers a lot  without socks. This liners work great. I wanted something that you could put in your shoes and leave them there because I like being able to just slip my shoes on and go. Perfect!,3
3,5,These are great! I love these!,3
3,4,"Easy to install, but haven't actually worn them yet.  Hopefully they will hold up and be comfortable enough to wear all day.",3
3,5,They are great.  I love how comfortable they are.  I don't even know I'm wearing them!,3
3,5,"They work, I love them. I hate to ware sox & these are perfect in every way.",3
3,5,fit great,3
3,5,They work just like you said they would. I love them. They are very comfortable. ,3
3,4,Amazing!  Shoes nor feet stink after wearing these.  Shipping does seem to take forever though.,3
3,5,"This is a wonderful product and the solution I have been searching for.  Solves the problems of wanting to wear shoes without socks showing, sweaty feet, and stinky shoes!  I love them and will definitely buy them for all my shoes that I want to wear without socks.  I watched the video for how to put them in my shoes.  This made it pretty easy.",3
3,4,    ,3
3,5,work great,3
3,4,"Kind of hard to install them perfectly in the bootie that I wanted to use them for. It's a tight shoe, so there wasn't much wiggle room to get the toe installed. Other than that, it seems like a cool idea that will work well once the installation has worn in. ",3
3,5,I have several pairs and love them. They are comfortable and very easy to use. ,3
3,5,"Love the Genius of this Product!

It's nice not to have to hunt around for  small socks - they're already in your shoes!  

Installation was a bit tricky for the first shoe - for me, who refuses to read instructions - it really would have made installation much easier.  Fortunately, Gekks are fool-proof, so even though this fool pulled the wrong thing  apart, it was easy to correct, and they fit perfectly anyway.  So first point - please read the instructions:  there are drawings, and the instructions are very clear. Installation in the second shoe was a breeze - following directions.

Geeks are pretty soft on the soles of your feet - I live in a cold climate, and winter feet can be a bit tender.  The Gekks feel fine.  They stay in place nicely, and don't bunch or wrinkle.  Another reason for proper installation - take your time, then you're set. 

As I only recently purchased the ballet and the loafer Gekks, am looking forward to how they hold up over time.  They seem sturdy, and flexibly comfortable.  I wouldn't use them in serious golf or tennis shoes, as you need more cushioning, but for everyday walking, they're excellent.

They have a pretty discreet look in your shoes, as well, when you take your shoes off.

I'll be purchasing more, as they work, and the price quite sensible - and summer is coming!!!  Thank you for making life a little softer and easier!



",3
3,5,Wonderful,3
3,4,I have not used them yet as I have a medical problem and unable to wear regular shoes at this time.  I am very hopeful they will resolve my narrow heel problems though once I am able to wear regular shoes.  ,3
3,5,"Amazing! I was skeptical about how well they would stay in place, but they are incredible! I will be ordering more!",3
3,5,Love them!!!,3
3,4,Very comfy and hidden,3
3,4,"Loved them, they exceeded my expectations. ",3
3,5,I love it.,3
3,4,These have saved my loafers and my feet no longer sweat and stink wearing these shoes all day. The only downside is the sticky part of the heel is coming off a little bit and my foot catches it each time I put my shoes on and the placement of the front toe is causing a wrinkle in my shoe. Installing was tricky and you only get one chance because of the sticky pads. ,3
3,4,I like the Gekks but they took forever to arrive!,3
3,4,I have only tried the loafer ones so far. I am not sure if the shoes are just slightly too small or the gekks. Buy the end of the day my big toes hurt. But loved that they didn't slip like my socks. Also when went to wear them the next time the tongue part came off but I put it back and it seemed to stay. Hope fully the slip ons will be even better. Love that my socks didn't slip though!!,3
3,5,Work great and I have already ordered more! Love my Gekks!,3
3,5,"Easy to use and seem to work great!
",3
3,5,Fit great and no more blisters ,3
3,5,Added Comfort to shoes! ,3
3,5,They are comfortable and they keep your feet from sweating ,3
3,5,"I'll be honest, I'm surprised these work so well. I was able to get rid of my heel pad and no more tiny socks falling into my shoe. It takes a bit to figure out how they work, but they stay in with velcro like stickers and can be removed.",3
3,5,"I'll be honest, I'm surprised these work so well. I was able to get rid of my heel pad and no more tiny socks falling into my shoe. It takes a bit to figure out how they work, but they stay in with velcro like stickers and can be removed.",3
3,5,So far so good!  Installation seems more difficult than it really is.  Not only does it help the stink in my Toms but helped the sweat as well. ,3
3,5,"very easy to apply and very comfortable, wish i could afford many pairs",3
3,5,great,3
3,5,So comfortable and easy to wear. ,3
3,5,Awesome!!!,3
3,4,"I do like them. They definitely keep your feet from sticking to the inside of the shoe. I didn't like the way the heel fit into any of my shoes. The gekk is square and the back of my shoes are not square. The bottom corners of the heel aren't flat. So far, that hasn't been a big problem, but I think the design could be better, particularly for women's shoes. 
",3
3,5,So far so good! I probably wouldn‚Äôt use them for my workout shoes but for daily wear I like them so far. ,3
3,5,Nice,3
3,5,"Excellent product, still wish you made socks as well!",3
3,5,These work really well in my slip-on sneakers. Walked a few miles in them and they stayed put. ,3
3,4,"They meet my expectations in all ways except trying to find the right size for my foot, my loafer, that allows for comfort room.  Also, seems high priced for the product.",3
3,5,"I have a pair of loafers that I hardly wore.  Now with the Gek Loafer insert, they're pretty comfortable.",3
3,5,They are perfect! Made wearing my loafers so much more enjoyable. ,3
3,5,Love the way the Gekks stay in my shoes!,3
3,5,where have these been????,3
3,4,"I love it....the only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating was because I've got on insert that stick! Sucks that I will have to buy a whole new set for one sticker! It was stuck on top of my toms and I think it was stuck on the elastic part. I think that made it not stick so I've got to reattach it every time I wear my shoes. It will stay in place because it's sandwiched between my shoe and my foot if I remember to fix it. If I don't, it's very uncomfortable!! ",3
3,5,there great,3
3,5,a bit pricey but a very good product,3
3,5,Love my gekks ,3
3,4,"I love all the geks!  They do make the shoes a bit snug, but not bad. ",3
3,4,First time using the loafer ones. A bit trickier to put in but love that I don't have to deal with sox that never stay up.    ,3
3,4,I love the way they work. I only wish I would have thought to buy more grippers for my other shoes. ,3
3,4,I like them but I didn't realize I would have to buy stickers to put in each pair of shoes that I wear them with. ,3
3,5,These have solved a big problem for me. Love them.,3
3,5,I LOVE THESE! I need more pairs! I'm a believer and a convert. Great great product. ,3
3,4,"I really like these ""socks"" but I did have a little trouble installing them properly and my pinky toes slip out every so often. Other than that they are AMAZING for the smell ballet flats can get at the end of the day! ",3
3,5,Great product and easy to use.,3
3,4,Love not needing socks! If placed just right they don't cramp my toes at all. I appreciate that the adhesive can be adjusted a couple of times. I'll buy again!,3
3,4,They are great and comfy but not as great at preventing odor as advertised. Still better than going barefoot in my shoes though. ,3
3,5,The Gekks are great!  They stay in place and are super comfortable.  I need to order some more!,3
3,4,Great! Love that the Gekks don't show but I still have the comfort of something between my feet and the shoes. My shoes are a tad more snug than I'd prefer with the added cushion of the grippers but I will just purchase a half size up next time I buy flats. ,3
3,5,so comfortable,3
3,5,Great!,3
3,5,They are great and convenient!,3
3,5,Perfect!  They are easy to put in and stay put. No more falling sock! üéâüéâüéâ,3
3,5,So far so great!,3
3,5,"I'm a Believer now! (But I was skeptical when I ordered them.) I'll admit the installation of the first Gekk was a bit intimidating, but I watched the how-to video and it went off so well that by the second shoe I felt like an expert.  Wore them in my Keds for a long day on my feet and they were amazing. More comfortable than any pair of socks! Now, I intend on introducing all my friends and family to this - the future of shoe wearing. ",3
3,5,Easy install,3
3,5,Love them.,3
3,5,So comfortable! I have a pare for each of my tieks.  ,3
3,5,Love them! ,3
3,5,Great investment. Doesn't even feel like an insert is in my shoes!,3
3,4,the 'installation' of them was very easy with the instructions given - I loved that.  So far these have been great.  With the spring and summer coming up I'll really be putting them to the test.  Great product!,3
3,5,"These weren't quite what I expected, cause I'm very bad at ordering stuff without fully reading how it works but I gotta say I'm pretty pleased with them anyways, worked out better than I even thought it would. ",3
3,5,They are awesome!! ,3
3,5,Met my expectations ,3
3,5,They are great.  My loafers can be worn without those socks that always fall off my heel!  These are fabulous.,3
3,5,I love Gekks!! I was really worried they wouldn't stay in place but they don't budge. They are super comfortable! I plan to buy them for all of my shoes!,3
3,5,Love them. Easy to insert and they stay in place also very comfortable!,3
3,5,These work better than expected! They have stayed in place so far even with shoving my feet into both of my Sperry's that I have them in. They are comfortable and keep your feet cooler and dry. ,3
3,5,Love! Just wish shipping hadn't taken so long!,3
3,5,"I loved them so much I immediately ordered more!!!! Where have these been all my life. Fit perfectly in my shoes, keep my feet from sweating, and keep my shoes from smelling. And they are washable, though it said only needed every couple months Soni can't review post wash yet",3
3,4,worked better than I had expected.  I really like them,3
3,5,Great! Exactly as expected.,3
3,5,"These are kind of different and took a bit to get used to. Overall all, I'm extremely happy with the product! ",3
3,4,"It's great! Really like it, giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't think it keeps like feet completely dry like advertised. I have other dry fit socks that do keep them 100% dry. But not a huge deal. Would buy again if shipping didn't take so long. Also, pricing is a little high for 1 pair.",3
3,5,Great fit!,3
3,5,Great product.  Love that I don't have to worry about sock liners anymore. ,3
3,5,"Finally the benefits of sock without all the slipping off your heel!
",3
3,4,"Not easy to install. The heel and toe strips come away from the shoe. One sock has a wrinkle in it that I can't get rid of. Otherwise, soft on the feet. Have worn them once. Wanted to try a pair for sneakers but out of stock. ",3
3,5,Love them!,3
3,5,Amazing! Life  changer!,3
3,5,They work great. Keep my feet dry and smell free!,3
3,4,"These are very well made and seem fairly easy to ""install"".  I didn't give them 5 stars, however, because it's winter and I haven't had a chance to go without socks yet!  Terrific idea!!!",3
3,5,"I love these things! I'm a first-time Gekks customer, and I have been raving about these smart inventions to everyone. My fiancee bought me a beautiful pair of patent leather nisolo loafers, and my last pair is essentially ruined from sockless stinky feet! So Gekks have been an awesome solution! My one adjustment would be that they come with an extra set of grippers, in case a dunce (like me) had a hard time installing them and they lost their sticky a little bit. ",3
3,5,I would never buy again! Product sounds good but difficult to use. Not happy with resultüòü,3
3,5,"I was skeptical, but wore them to work all day with no problems. ",3
3,5,"They perform just as advertised. No slip and no stink! I love them!
",3
3,5,I love these.  I would love if there was also an option to have some to use like socks so I could wear them in several shoes...more cost effective.,3
3,5,"So easy to install and comfortable! I'm so happy I can wear my Sperry boat shoes without looking for socks first, or without smelling them up by not wearing socks and forcing me to buy new shoes! I will be buying more for my other shoes!",3
3,5,So perfect ,3
3,5,I am absolutely loving my gekks. They are so comfortable and it feels like I am wearing a sock inside the shoe. These things are awesome and I want these in every single pair of shoes I own! ,3
3,5,Perfect fit,3
3,5,Good,3
3,4,Took a few minutes to install in the first pair of loafers but I was quicker with the second pair. Overall good. ,3
3,5,I bought for my son and husband and they love them. First pair was a little tricky to install but worth any trouble you may encounter .,3
3,5,"Love them! No more sweaty feet, no more slip-on liners that don't stay put. The Gekks liners stay in place and are very comfortable! Highly recommend.",3
3,4,"So far I like them, but I feel like it is missing a velcro patch on the tow section.  Right now the ankle, heel, and top where it connects to the tongue of the shoe is anchored down, but the toe portion is loose (making it feel like I'm slipping my foot into a sock when I put the show on).  Aside from that being a little weird, I am hopeful it will prevent my feet and shoes from smelling and having to wear slip on socks!",3
3,5,Love them!,3
3,5,Amazing! Perfect for shoes that just do not work with socks and so much better than those little socks that pop off.,3
3,5,"I love them never have stinky feet  and I  have a couple of pairs so they are in my loafers, and my boat shoes just bought them for the FAM. ",3
3,4,"I like them so far, the first side I put in was a little lumpy but by the other shoe I understood better how to install. Soft and so far so good",3
3,4,Great product.  Lost one star only because the instructions are a bit complicated; if they could be improved it would be perfect!,3
3,4,I like them but wish the edges would not roll up from the gripper.,3
3,5,Love it ,3
3,5,Wonderful!!!,3
3,5,These are the best things ever! So easy to put in and so comfortable to wear!,3
3,5,Loved them!!  The smell is gone and my toes stay warm!!,3
3,5,These are great! They take a few minutes to get in place but totally worth it. My son and husband love them too,3
3,5,perfect in my converse! ,3
3,5,Need more of these!!!!,3
3,5,They are awesome!  Loved loved loved them!  Ordering more soon for myself and for Christmas presents. ,3
3,5,Love them! ,3
3,5,Love that I do not have to wear socks with my Sperry's and the  Gekks for my ballet flats fit perfectly.,3
3,5,"These are amazing!  There is a learning curve for installation but once in they work great.  I bought some for my daughter to prolong the life of her school shoes and she loves them too!
",3
3,5,"Was skeptical his these would feel and work.  I'm sold!  Very comfy, functional and ez to use.  I will be buying more for the rest of my shoes!",3
3,5,"Great product! Took a bit to figure out the initial insertion process, but by my second pair it was a no-brainer. Love how comfortable they make my shoes without adding bulk. Easy to put in, easy to wear. Can't wait to give them as gifts!!",3
3,5,Awesome so far!,3
3,5,great so far! ,3
3,5,"I love these even more than I thought I would. The ""sock"" feels silky and lets my feet breathe. They have also helped my shoes feel more comfortable. ",3
3,5,These are the sockless solution I have been looking for!! No more slippage of no show socks. I highly recommend this product!,3
3,4,"They worked well once on, but they were frustrating to put my feet into and take my feet out of.",3
3,5,it is kind of not the time of year to get much use of them but i have tried them out and worn several times and i like them very much. i will most def. buy more next season! it was a great referral from a friend....,3
3,5,Love 'em!,3
3,5,I love my geeks. They are so comfortable. ,3
3,4,"These are really great! They're pretty easy to install, but make sure you take your time and go slow so you don't get any wrinkles. I managed to do one shoe perfectly and I got a few wrinkles in the other one, but I couldn't really tell a difference. I have worn my shoes with Gekks twice and I was on my feet and walking around for several hours each time. They've held up pretty well. One of the heels is starting to rub slightly, so I need to check to make sure everything is aligned properly. Other than that, I'm really happy with them and plan to buy more. They don't stink and they absolutely do not show!",3
3,5,Love these!,3
3,5,love them so much!! I want more,3
3,5,"Once in, I loved them. And for those that asked, yes they work in Tieks (the slip ons)!",3
3,5,Love my Gekks!,3
3,4,"shipping was very slow, but the product is exactly what i was looking for. gekks are extremely comfortable and easy enough to install. i will be recommending them!",3
3,4,"I purchased both loafers and slip-ons. I have yet to use the slip ons and I hope they performed as well as the loafers did. It was a bit of a challenge to insert the gripper into the loafer, especially the tongue and secure it. Once I got them in they fit quite well and stayed in place. ",3
3,5,I don't think I've ever loved a product more in my life than I have these Gekks.  They are genius and I love them.  Need a spokesperson?  I will talk them up to anyone.  ,3
3,4,They r good so far,3
3,4,"Wish they came in beige color, but otherwise, worked very well!",3
3,5,"Comfortable. Didn't install the holders in any shoe, just so I could slip them in to whatever shoe I wanted. They stayed in one place the whole time, and were very comfortable.",3
3,4,"Work well.
",3
3,5,"I was skeptical that it was going to deliver on the promises.  I was wonderfully wrong.  I didn't think they would stay in place.  Not only do they stay in place, but added a bit of comfort.  The best part is that the Gekks keep my shoes smell-free.  I didn't think that would be possible after wearing the shoes everyday during the week.  In addition, my days are long and stressful.  I am truly impressed.",3
3,4,These are really cool. They are easy to put in and are comfortable to wear. The only thing I don't love about them is you can't switch them between shoes unless you buy additional adhesive liners. Basically the sock sticks to these liners and the socks can be removed but the liners themselves are single use. It's just a bummer I can only use these in one shoe but still very cool!,3
3,5,I am absolutely in love with my gekks. I have needed this all my life as I HATE wearing socks. So my family actually always makes jokes about my stinky shoes but I just hate socks. I end up just tossing my shoes after so long of spraying and powdering them. These are a total game changer for me. ,3
3,5,"Gekks have made my shoes so much better! I can't stand not wearing socks with shoes and these are the absolute perfect solution. They don't slip, they don't affect the size of my shoe, and they're completely unnoticeable. LOVE THEM!",3
3,5,Pretty cool!,3
3,5,Perfect for what I wanted and needed.,3
3,5,"Very comfortable. Only wore them once, but so far so good. 
",3
3,5,"Loved them, no more sweaty feet!",3
3,5,Awesome product!,3
3,5,Work great and definitely worth the cost!,3
3,5,These are amazing. Like wearing socks without the socks feeling!! I also noticed they don't pinch my toes like regular socks do. I'm hooked. ,3
3,5,I've only tried one so far and have liked it.,3
3,5,"I love them!! They are so comfortable and there is no slippage. I haven't washed them yet, but I am already ready to purchase more!! Great product! ",3
3,5,They are SO awesome! I don't know how I lived without them!,3
3,5,"My boyfriend and I both love Gekks! I was worried that his wouldn't fit because he's a size 15 in men's but Gekks did not fail to disappoint. I was pretty hesitant in ordering because 11.5+ doesn't seem like a size that could cover someone who is size 15. But it did! I ordered the largest size for women's and it fit perfectly on my size 10 feet. I will definitely be buying more for myself, my boyfriend and even my mom who also loves the sockless look!",3
3,4,The Geeks took some time to properly place in the slip on but once in they were great!,3
3,5,I love my new socks! They fit perfectly in my sailing shoes and my feet felt super fresh after walking around for an entire day.,3
3,5,A vast improvement on my Sperry sneakers. Before my feet were super sweaty and stinky now I can wear them for hours comfortably. Would highly recommend.,3
3,5,These inserts are comfortable and keep my feet from getting sweaty! Love them!!,3
3,5,"These are a game changer. Comfortable and odorless sock alternative, what more could you ask for?!",3
3,5,"These things are great! It is so nice to not have to fuss with no-show socks when wearing my sneakers, or sweaty feet sticking to the inside of my loafers. Even my husband - who thought the idea was stupid - loves his. And the colors are great! Thanks for creating a useful, fun product.",3
3,5,"I feel like I have been waiting my entire adult life for someone to create exactly what Gekks are!! They're perfect for anyone who wears oxfords, loafers, Chucks, Vans, or any of those tricky shoes where you can never get a sock to stay up in!! Looking forward to outfitting the rest of my shoes with them ASAP. Thanks for making life easier Gekks :)",3
3,5,"I was curious, and am willing to try most things once. These keep my feet dry in my favorite shoes in the humid summer weather. Highly, highly recommended.",3
3,5,These are great! No more stinky feet!,3
3,5,This is a great product!,3
3,5,"I have always struggled with the little socks or nylons that I used to wear with my flats and loafers. They would slip down my ankle and under my feet as I walked no matter what I did to prevent it. But now, with Gekks, I don't have any problems with my shoes and my feet feel wonderful and cool while using Gekks. Most importantly, I use them in my golf shoes, which are a loafer style. I used to go sock-less in my golf shoes, now I have the Gekks installed and they feel great and I never have to worry about them sliding down under my foot while I golf. Thank You Gekks!!",3
3,5,I love Gekks! I am so in love with These things! My shoes don't stink and I don't have the uncomfortable sock seam anymore!!!! Love love love!,3
3,5,These work perfectly in my dress and casual shoes! They are just what I wanted! Love them!,3
3,5,"I used my new Gekks inserts in my Sperry top siders and they work fantastic! Even on the hottest days, and we have had record breakers, they keep my feet comfy with no odor! Yay!",3
3,5,I loved the experience of going sockless without the worry,3
3,5,I love these things. They make a huge difference. Easy to put in and super comfy.,3
3,5,Very comfortable and stink-free! I put Gekks in my smelliest pair of loafers as a true test and have been extremely happy with the result. I will definitely buy more pairs and recommend to friends!,3
3,5,Life changing freedom for your feet!,3
3,5,I absolutely love these! No footies sliding down all day long and no stinky feet. Need to buy more...,3
3,5,"I love my gekks!
ordering more!!",3
3,5,i really love my Gekks. They actually work. It was a noticeable difference from wearing socks and my slip-ons to just Gekks. Highly recommended. I will be buying more in the future.,3
3,5,I was hopeful & surprised at how well the product works! They have stayed in my shoes & have passed the sniff test even after a full day of wear!,3
3,5,Where have these been all my life? Finally no fighting with little bootie socks that don't stay on and always show anyway. These were a wonderful fit and comfortable from the minute I put them on. Wore them all day at the lake taking my shoes on and off multiple times. No stink and no slipping around in my shoes when my feet sweat. I'll be ordering more!,3
3,5,"Wearing those """"no show"""" socks has always been a problem for me because they always show just a little. My Gekks have solved that problem!",3
3,5,I wear them with my TOMS and love them!,3
3,5,"I'm loving my Gekks! I put them into a brand new pair of Toms because I can not stand to see sock lines and I have worn them 4-5 times for full days and no smell!! I suffer from sweaty feet, especially in the summer and these seem to be working well!! Can't wait to tell others about them!",3
3,5,They are different than I expected especially with how you put it together and I thought they'd be odorless but I feel at ease knowing I don't have to wear thick socks with my nice loafers.,3
3,5,Gekks is so revolutionary!  I've been using them a week and it's been so wonderful.  Makes my mornings so much easier not having to find socks and put them on before I put on my shoes.  Now I just slip on my shoes with my Gekks in them.  Such a time saver.,3
3,4,I like these for my slip ons though you can just slip your foot in and out. You have to hold the heel and the tongue of the shoe so they don't slip. They are fairly convenient and beat the no show socks that slip in the back. ,3
3,4,Works as designed. Very happy with the product! ,3
3,5,Great idea. You need these and I need more!,3
3,5,Amazing! Easy to install and comfortable. Now if only they had them for high heels. ;),3
3,5,"Great for my twisted X shoes, put in and leave them!!",3
3,5,Seriously comfortable and their claims about the odor hold up. Very impressed and I'm going to be buying more!,3
5,4,"Good socks, not for all heels/wedges.",5
5,5,Love my gekks! They work great and are very comfortable. Im buying them for all my shoes from now on!,5
5,5,Love Love Love! These are the best things ever. I don‚Äôt even feel them when I‚Äôm wearing my heels!,5
5,5,Great for heals. Don‚Äôt bunch up around the toes. ,5
5,5,Great for heals. Don‚Äôt bunch up around the toes. ,5
5,5,Great for heals. Don‚Äôt bunch up around the toes. ,5
5,5,"I thought it was going to be tight but no, they are great!",5
5,5,Perfect! ,5
5,5,Love them!  They've made a huge difference!  ,5
5,5,I bought two pairs to put in some wedges I wear all the time to work that get smelly towards the end of the day. What a difference! Thank you for allowing me to keep my favorite pair of shoes!,5
5,5,"Geeks for heels are amazing. Love wearing shoes barefoot and these are so comfortable. Just slip in and out of them. Haven't washed them yet, but optimistic that they will not lose their stickiness to adhere to the shoe.  Am ordering more so I don't have to share with other shoes.  ",5
5,5,Great! Very happy,5
5,5,Great product! I can't believe that these things work so well.  I bought them based on an Instagram targeted ad and I'm glad I did.  ,5
5,5,Game changer!,5
5,5,Have not tried these yet but the loafers and ballet fly ones are awesome so far!,5
5,5,Thank heavens for Gekks!!,5
5,4,"I love the concept, but in one pair of Danskos that I put them in, there is too much in the corners of the heel and I don't like the little fold that developed under my heel over the course of a day.  In the other pair I tried them in, probably no one noticed, but the green border felt fluorescent to me, as it was even with the top of the back of the shoe.  Otherwise, yes, it was more comfortable than with bare feet.",5
5,5,Comfortable and stay put :),5
5,4,Seem to work well. ,5
5,4,haven't used them yet,5
5,5,I really like these as I absolutely hate putting my bare feet into any shoe.   They are thin and stay in place. The one thing that I feel would improve these is that if on the heel version they add a small silicone strip on the inside to help grab your foot and keep it from slipping out. ,5
5,5,They fit in my heels perfectly. Will be purchasing a couple more pairs. ,5
5,5,These are a great idea but be sure you know what size to order.  I go between a 6 1/2 and 7 shoe so I ordered the 7 but should have downsized to the 6 1/2.,5
5,5,Great product!,5
5,5,"I was skeptical but now am sold on this product. I used to go sockless so there is reduced foot/shoe friction, cooler so no damp shoe leather from hot feet, no wet leather smell, washing them is easy. Really love these socks! ",5
5,4,great,5
5,5,Love these socks!! ,5
5,5,don't have to worry about the footies slipping under my arches - Gekks are perfect,5
5,5,"These are great, thank you. I just wish I could purchase a bundle of heels & wedges only, instead of a closet pack to get a discount since this is what I wear to work.",5
5,5,They fit great! They are so comfortable and it is much more convenient than standard no-show socks. ,5
5,5,"Love these inserts! So easy, and reusable. ",5
5,5,Excellent for very low-cut heels.  Comfortable.,5
5,5,Love these!,5
5,4,"I like Gekks, I have them in all of my shoes. They work as described. My last purchase however was different. One side separated from the adhesive part. Not sure how or why. ",5
5,5,Love having socks inside my heels.  So much more comfortable!,5
5,4,I really do like the comfort of these. Maybe I'm missing something but I can't get them to stick again.  But they do stay in place even if they aren't stuck in. ,5
5,4,Love these. They work great in my Tory Burch flats.,5
5,5,great - buying more.  ,5
5,5,I have needed a product like this for years!  I love being able to wear my favorite heels without tights and have my feet be comfortable and much less sweaty!  The insole of my heels also look much nicer with the Gekks installed.  Looking forward to getting more Gekks as needed for my flats!,5
5,5,Absolutely love the Gekks in my heels! I never wear nylons in spring or summer and my feet are usually sticky and rubbed raw - not with Gekks! I need MORE!,5
5,5,"Love these so much. I've bought my friend some for her wedding shoes. My niece for her prom shoes. My daughter for her Chuck Taylor's (which cut down of the sink, a lot) and she says they make them even more comfortable.",5
5,4,"I like them but once they‚Äôre in the shoe, it‚Äôs not easy to make sure my toes slide properly in the small toe space. ",5
5,5,The Heels Gekks are perfect! I love them. ,5
5,5,Perfect! I could never find socks for my heels that were truly no show... until now!,5
5,5,Definitely the best: stays in place and very comfy,5
5,4,These fit perfectly in my size 6.5 heels! I can wear the heels all day and it's so convenient to not have to worry about socks slipping off like I did before. I do wish shipping was faster. It took 2 weeks for the item to arrive in Northern California. ,5
5,5,"I love that they are low profile and hide inside my shoes.  I‚Äôve bought so many toe socks, heal socks, etc but the always stick out of my shoes ruining the look.  I am happy to have found these socks for multiple types of shoes!",5
5,4,These are the best thing ever for heels and ballet flats.  Didn't give five stars because the top of the toe section tends to roll up when I slip my feet in so it is difficult to smooth it out and prevent rubbing there.,5
5,5,"I love that they are low profile and hide inside my shoes.  I‚Äôve bought so many toe socks, heal socks, etc but the always stick out of my shoes ruining the look.  I am happy to have found these socks for multiple types of shoes!",5
5,5,I love it.,5
5,5,Love them all so far!,5
5,5,Love them!!!,5
5,5,I love them!  Looking at buying some more. ,5
5,5,Works just like they stated.  Love these!,5
5,5,"Easy to put in the shoes, comfortable and they stayed put all day",5
5,5,LOVE them!! No longer have to worry about messing up the inside of expensive new shoes! ,5
5,5,Love this!,5
5,4,The small size fits my shoes well. I love that the liners stick into the shoes. The liners do need to be washed/refreshed if worn for full workdays. My only complaint is that the underside of the heel sticky pad should be larger and stickier.,5
5,5,"Oh my gosh.  I have waited for years for Gekks. I can wear my wedges comfortably all day with the comfort and hygiene of socks.  No more sweaty feet and shoes, no elastic biting into my feet from ‚Äúno show ‚Äú liners that either pull up at the heel or or migrate to the toes.  I love these.",5
5,5,Love these!  I only wish there was some way to make them fir open toe and a bed of the shoe liner for sandals.,5
5,5,        ,5
5,4,Back of sock came above the heel. Also feel the contrast thread at top doesn‚Äôt blend well with fancy heels.,5
5,4,"I truly like these for flats especially but for heels with a pointy toe, just fair. As it seems to bunch up because the Gekks are round not pointy!",5
5,5,"These are amazing! They feel good, keep my feet from getting slimy and slippery, and are completely invisible in my wedges. I thought at first they may cause blisters but I went the entire first day with no problems. I'm recommending them to all my friends. ",5
5,4,Comfy and worked with shoes I've always avoided wearing!,5
5,5,"So far so good. Today is the first day I am wearing them in my low heels. Initially, I could feel the ridges on the bottom, but now a few hours later I don't feel anything. It is still a little chilly outside. The real test will be summertime when I can see how they hold up to the excessive sweat. ",5
5,5,"They work great!  Will definitely be ordering more for any new shoes I buy. The ones I received recently are also a lot easier to apply, so thank you for that!",5
6,5,"You can‚Äôt ask for a better alternative to those useless sockettes. Easy to put on and off, easy to wash, reliable.",6
6,4,Works as expected!,6
6,5,Gekks are one of the best inventions and to date the best impulse purchase I have ever made.,6
6,5,Great purchase ever!!!,6
6,5,Great product. Maybe have step by step instructions in website.,6
6,5,These are great! ,6
6,5,"Fit nicely, clear directions ",6
6,5,It is awesome and excellent.  No more socks to show with penny loafer.,6
6,5,Gekks are the best! More comfortable than socks and a sleek sockless style.,6
6,5,"Love this product, always consistent!",6
6,5,"They are wonderful. Stayed put, no sweaty feet! Met all expectations.",6
6,4,Probably should have gotten a size larger. Great product.,6
6,5,My husband loves them! Easy to install.  Great alternative to other no show socks. ,6
6,5,Installation was straight forward and I have loved the fit and feel of the Gekks ‚Äî no more crumpled up low-cut socks!,6
4,5,"So far so good! Getting these into sneakers for the first time was a little bit of a project. Everything is clearly labelled and they've dummy proofed this as far as humanly possible with graphics and English text but putting them in for the first time was a longer process than I originally allotted and I would up with some wrinkles.  But it was easily fixed once I got the hang of it. The ones for ballet flats are easy, and I LOVE having them ready to go. 
With my work shoes the test will be time. I work on my feet 16 hours a day. My work shoes get STINKY.  And comfort is also a big factor.  For a week they've been great.  So far no odor in brand new shoes , and once I got the wrinkles smoothed out, comfy enough but a bit warmer than my normal cotton foot socks. So definitely recommend for ballet flats- not having to chase down those tiny socklet things makes them worth their weight in gold- and I recommend them with qualifications for sneakers. Ask me again when I've worked in them for 200 hours! But I think it'll be great!
",4
4,5,"Loving these so far! I was surprised how soft and comfortable they are. Easy to fit- I have a little bit of puckering at the heel, but it doesn't seem to be an issue, and they are very easy to slide in and out of. Very happy with my sneaker Gekks.",4
4,5,I love that I don‚Äôt have to put on socks anymore. My feet never smell with the technology in gekks inserts.,4
4,5,Love them,4
4,5,"These are perfect for my Sperrys, no more socks slipping down all day!",4
4,5,"Super shopping experience. Geeks are soft, comfortable and convenient.",4
4,5,I love the gekks!  They are not too thick nor too thin and are very soft against my feet.  I love being able to quickly slip my sneakers on and off and no more no-show socks slipping into my shoes!!,4
4,4,"These are great!
",4
4,5,I LOVE the Gekks. This is my second pair. So much more comfortable than peds and no stinky shoes. ,4
4,5,Love,4
4,5,Works amazingly!!!,4
4,4,"Overall I love my Gekks! My only critique so far is that the feel tab never feels quite right. Even when placed as far back (even far back enough that it sticks up at the top of my converse), it tended to slip down a bit and give me the sensation that ""my socks are falling down"" which is pretty annoying.I do appreciate the fact that they aren't bulky at all and the seams lie flat. ",4
4,4,Love the way they feel. I found it a bit difficult to put in my shoes and I am not quite sure I understand the process of removing and cleaning them.,4
4,5,"Love them! I wear them in my sneakers. I have orthotics and strange feet. I stuck them to my orthotics and they work perfectly. Hint....do not line them up on the arch side but rather the outside of the foot when you wear orthotics.
",4
4,5,Gekks are amazing.  The are  so comfortable that you don‚Äôt even know they are in your shoes.  I will definitely buy a few more.,4
4,4,"Found it a little hard to insert them correctly. Maybe because I wear wide shoes. Also, will have to remove them to wear shoes with socks again.",4
4,5,I was really dubious about these given the price but I wear a size 10 and have difficulty finding no-show socks in my size that are comfortable and don‚Äôt slip down so i decided to try the Gekks. I‚Äôm totally sold-they are unbelievably comfortable. Going to get pairs for all my summer shoes!,4
4,5,"So comfy. I wish they were a bit longer as I have size 11 feet, but they still are better than those stupid socks!",4
4,5,"So far, so good! The liners are very soft and comfortable. The added padding in the heel made my new sneakers more comfortable as well (the right one had been giving me a blister without them). Since my shoes are a little tight, it can be hard to get them on/off without pushing the heel liner down and having to readjust. I am hoping this won't cause the stickiness to wear out faster.",4
4,5,So far I love them!,4
4,5,"It's the first time I can wear sneakers with the ""no socks"" look! Sneakers used to always swallow up any low-cut socks I wore.",4
4,5,Changed my life! No longer have to wear those tiny little socks in my flats that pinch my feet! LOVE THEM!,4
4,5,Loved them. ,4
4,5,Love the new model!,4
4,4,Easy to apply,4
4,5,"They work perfectly! They were easy to stick inside my shoe, they stay put, and are more comfortable than the no show socks I used to use. ",4
4,5,"love them so far,  haven't tried to wash them yet",4
4,5,great,4
4,4,"I bought two pairs of the sneaker-size gekks, one for a pair of Chuck Taylor's and the other for a pair of dress shoes. The Converse ones work great, no more running out of no-shows or rubbing on my heels. I love them!

They didn't work at all in my dress shoes, though. I'm not sure if it was the fit of that particular shoe or what, but I've resolved myself to taping my heels. Luckily, I have more Converse so I'm still getting use out of the second pair.",4
4,5,Great product!,4
4,5,Very nice,4
4,5,"These sock-less liners are GREAT. I placed them in a pair of inexpensive sneakers and have had no sores or blisters. They stay in place and move only slightly when taking your shoe off, but is easily pushed back down. I will be buying more in addition to trying a pair in flats. Great idea and so clever!!",4
4,5,They are great,4
4,5,"Excellent product, still wish you made socks as well!",4
4,5,They were easy to insert and I can't believe how they stay in place.,4
4,5,Makes wearing sneakers effortless and comfortable.  Genius idea!,4
4,5,I am a huge fan of gekks!  I'm about to buy some for my high heels.,4
4,5,"No ""no-show"" sock can compare! These are awesome! And, I became a customer just in time for spring shoe weather! Huzzah!",4
4,5,"I LOVE GEKKS SOOOO MUCH,I feel like I should be getting free pairs because pretty much everytime I see someone wearing shoes with no show socks or without,I always tell them how much I LOVE them, even kicking off my shoes to show how great they are.  I just wish it didn't take so long for them to be delivered.  If I buy new shoes,I now ALWAYS put Gekks in them.  So sometime I have to wait two or more weeks for them to come,but they are so worth the wait.  These are complete game changers for a shoe loving girl like me.  I do wish they made liners for sandals.   Maybe someday.",4
4,5,"Actually, my 5 star rating is for the ballet flats Gekks...I LOVE the way my feet don't slip and slide anymore; no more knee highs or thin socks!  I am getting ready to order more for the rest of my flats shoe wardrobe.  THANK YOU!",4
4,5,"So tired of the little socks sliding down the heel, so when I saw the promo for this product, I ordered a pair immediately. As I had just received a brand new quite expensive pair of runners I thought this would be the perfect opportunity. Watched the installation vid, no problem getting them in and have worn several times. They are soft, comfortable and reallly blend in with shoe, like being barefoot. Haven‚Äôt washed yet so don‚Äôt know how that works, but will def order again.",4
4,5,these are perfect in my ecco sneakers,4
4,5,Love these shoe socks. Very comfortable and they stay pit in the shoe.  Easy to apply!,4
4,5,This is my 3rd purchase of Gekks. Every new pair of shoes I buy that I want to go sockless in gets a pair of Gekks. Thanks!!,4
4,4,"the fit is great and my feed dont hurt .But they are hardto get on and stiff,i hope with use they will soften up.",4
4,4,"I like my Gs now that I‚Äôve gotten them in my different shoes, but there is definitely a bit of an art to get them in correctly. I may have broken a pair of Gs trying to get them into my chucks. :) once in, my Gs haven‚Äôt slipped at all and feel super comfy in my shoes. I‚Äôd definitely recommend these. ",4
4,5,Very impressed ,4
4,4,These are pretty great so far. I‚Äôm reserving that last star because it hasn‚Äôt been long enough to see how well they hold up. But overall I‚Äôm very pleased. ,4
4,4,Just put them in and they seem to work well. No experience over time yet. It‚Äôs a great idea!,4
4,4,Love them! Just need to learn how to stick them in better so you can‚Äôt see the green stitching. ü§ì,4
4,5,bought these for my teen daughter.  she loves them,4
4,5,I like not having to wear additional socks. These never show. ,4
4,5,What do I think? I think I need to order more ,4
4,5,I love them!!,4
4,5,"I love the lace-ups! I have them in all of my converse, which is what I normally wear. The product performs as promised, and they are very comfortable.",4
4,4,"These I like.  Really comfy for my athletic shoes.  
",4
4,5,I have a history of sweat and bad foot odor. Powders and sprays never worked for me. I love these because they're so durable and thin. They look great in my chucks as well as my work flats. ,4
4,5,great,4
4,5,These are better than expected.no sock slipping off my feet.,4
4,5,"They work great! I love #1 not having to find socks and #2 being able wear ‚Äúno socks‚Äù, which my sweaty feet prevented before gekks!",4
4,4,"Really surprised by how well these work. 

Unfortunately they get sweaty like any of your socks would, and I have yet to wash them and refurbish the adhesive. 

But so far they are bringing ease and general comfort to wearing shoes I normally have issues with, since my no-show socks fall down all the time. ",4
4,5,"These inserts really work - no more blisters and sweaty feet!  Thank you, Gekks!",4
4,5,I had no idea how this would work - it is pretty amazing. Like wearing socks except they are always there!,4
4,5,Comfortable! Bought for my daughters cheer shoes and they definitely absorb sweat and odor and she loves them. ,4
4,4,"They were a bit difficult to put in my shoe, but once I got them in they great! Love not having to wear regular no show socks that either show, or slide down! And they don‚Äôt smell!",4
4,5,The work nice and they are easy to install in my shoes,4
4,4,Not too bad but a bit tricky  to install in converse,4
4,5,"Love them, easy to insert and like not wearing socks minus the blisters.",4
4,5,Love these crazy things!,4
4,4,I purchased both the sneaker and flats inserts. I was surprised how easy it was to insert and how comfortable inside the shoe they were. The only poor things I'd have to say is that price wise this is a little bit much....especially because it took forever to actually receive them. ,4
4,5,I LOVE my geeks! Not having to constantly dig for my fallen heel in my shoe has actually made life more enjoyable! ,4
4,5,Love it,4
4,4,"These are great!  Definitely cuts down on the odor from not wearing socks & my feet don‚Äôt get sweaty!  Hoping the adhesive will hold up as promised.  So far, so good!",4
4,5,I‚Äôve only had them a few weeks but so far they‚Äôre great. They stay in place and so far they don‚Äôt stink. Will buy more. ,4
4,5,great idea - love the no show and they are comfortable.  ,4
4,5,I wasn‚Äôt sure these would be as awesome as they have advertised but they are! Wore my Keds today and for the first didn‚Äôt have all that bunching and I want to throw this sock away feeling. So recommend these!,4
4,5,I don't like to wear socks! These are great quality and perfect for my tennis shoes. ,4
4,4,"Really nice once you get them installed. Installation is difficult but can‚Äôt see any other way to do it. 
",4
4,5,10/10 would buy again,4
4,5,Bought these for my niece for Christmas and she lives them! Wears with her Toms n Converses. She always complained about  the little socks slipping down on her heel.  Great product and will order more.,4
4,5,"Didn‚Äôt exactly insert them per instructions, but love them!",4
4,5,I was looking for something that would help with the blisters and this did just that,4
4,4,I love the convenience of my Gekks in my sneakers. The best thing about them is no more no-show socks worn half way down my foot all day! The only complaint is the difficulty pulling the paper off to expose the adhesive area. Please add a small tab to grab the paper. These are great! ,4
4,5,Great,4
4,4,They aren't exactly what I was expecting but I like them. It's taking some getting used to putting them on. I think I'll try the flats pair next.,4
4,5,Exactly what I had hoped for! ,4
4,5,I love these!  Now i can just slip my feet in and go!,4
4,5,It really is a revolutionary new way to sock! ,4
4,4,Great!,4
4,4,"I have conflicting feeling about gekks- I bought the sneaker ones to wear in my converse. The good part is that ive has the gekks in for a couple weeks, and they are exactly as advertised. The bad part is that the sneaker gekks come with three sticker parts apiece, and mine were missing one of the sticker pieces that goes on the tongue of the shoe. (Come on gekks, ship an appropriate number of parts with your product!) The ugly part was the customer service. My product took almost 3 weeks to ship and I had to keep emailing to get status updates! Adding insult to injury, the shopping took longer than expected. So- great product, questionable quality control, poor customer experience. ",4
4,5,"I was a little skeptical, but they actually work!  I really like them.",4
4,4,I struggled a little with putting them in my sneaker but I really do like them. Thanks ,4
4,5,"Love them!  So easy to insert, and so effortless to use.",4
4,4,Fit really well in my Vans. A little tricky to get in place but once I figured it out the second shoe was easy.  Very comfortable ,4
4,4,"Easy to install, soft material, and good quality. I just can't give 5 stars because the order processing and shipping took forever! I ordered them on 8/26 but they didn't arrive until 9/19 (17 business days!). ",4
4,5,They fit perfectly in sneakers and don't slide around.,4
4,4,"So far so good- I have the slip on converse and the back is tricky to keep the Gekks secured tightly.
The do make my shoes a little tight, which I was hoping to avoid with not needing socks.   I am thinking for this show type I should have done a different style Gekk.  
But I love they they are no show and no more bunching from different sock options!!  üëçüèª",4
4,4,They made my ballet slipper Tieks way too tight!!! ,4
4,4,"Seem great so far! It was a little tricky putting them in and not getting wrinkles. And they seem to keep the worst smell away so far but the edges seem to peel away a little and expose the ""sticker"" part and sometimes it rubs me. I'm also concerned with when I need to wash the shoes bc I'm a mom who sometimes has to run through mud. ",4
4,5,"they're great! comfortable, they breathe well and i don't have to worry about fussing with tiny socks anymore",4
4,4,"An annoying struggle to put them in, I wish they sent three inserts so you can ruin the first one on install, like I did. But once they were in, they felt great. I can wear my Chucks with comfort now.",4
4,5,Very comfortable! Perfect scenario: install in new shoes. Grippers slip a bit in older/worn shoes.,4
4,4,Awesome!,4
4,4,Good to go,4
4,4,Works great! My only complains is that I've already worn a hole in the toes of one pair. I wear a women's size 10 and bought the large for 9+. ,4
4,5,New design. Love them and they really work!,4
4,4,"I have been using them in my slip on Converse and it took a little getting used to. It still feels like you're wearing socks (which I was going it wouldn't), but they don't slide anywhere and they keep any odor away, unlike going barefoot!! I wish they had them in kids sizes! 

When you put them in your shoe, they stick to the inside sole about 3/4 of the length, the inside of the back heel and the underside of the tongue of the shoe. The toe part of the liner is loose and stretches to fit your foot when you put the shoe on. Before I put it on, I have to adjust the inside of it a little, otherwise, it feels a little twisted when I put it on. I think it just gets that way from taking the shoe off and it's an easy fix.

Overall, I think they are worth the money and I don't have to worry about my no show socks slipping around or having stinky feet from trying to go barefoot in my converse!",4
4,5,They were great!  Exactly what I needed!  No more blisters!,4
4,5,Love them!,4
4,5,Love them!!,4
4,5,"They're great!
",4
4,4,Same as my review for the loafers slip-ons,4
4,5,Very comfortable and makes slipping in and out of shoes easy!,4
4,4,"I like them. I wish I could say I love them, but they have a few issues. 1) hard to install and if you don't install them perfect on the first try, you don't another chance to do it right. 2) possibly due to me screwing it up when I put them in, the bottom of the sock gets caught under the Velcro stuff on the bottom and I have to put my shoe on and then mess around with it until it's not bunched up. Other than those two things though I do like them and like that I don't have to go looking for my tiny noshow socks whenever I want to wear my Vans. Maybe for the price it should come with an extra backing in case you mess up the install?",4
4,5,"My experience using the Gekks inserts has been awesome.  I thought that I was nuts for spending so much on something I knew nothing about, but I am not disappointed. Wearing shoes without some kind of sock or footie was a no-no for me.  These are perfect!  ",4
4,5,"Love the Gekks! Easy to install (found it easier to keep the Gekks sock on the grippers), fits great, my feet don't sweat, and no smell even when wearing them all day in the heat! ",4
4,5,"Love them, some sneakers I don't want the ""sock look""!",4
4,4,Love my Gekks so far!  Comfortable and keep my feet dry all day!,4
4,5,"A little tricky to put in at first, but once you figure it out... they are unbelievable!!! I was so comfortable in my shoes all day!",4
4,5,"A little tricky to put in at first, but once you figure it out... they are unbelievable!!! I was so comfortable in my shoes all day!",4
4,5,Gekks are great. ,4
4,5,I have Vince slip-on sneakers that I love but have never really been able to wear them because my feet sweat so much and my feet slide around. I purchased Gekks to put in them and now I wear the shoes every day! I love the soft feel of Gekks and how they absorb moisture! I highly recommend! ,4
4,5,These are great! They are comfortable and work exactly the way they are advertised! I would recommend these to anyone. ,4
4,5,Great for wearing sneakers without socks ,4
4,5,"I haven't had a chance to wear them very often yet, but I do love the way they feel so far!!",4
4,4,"I bought a pair to wear with  slip-on sneakers that are too hot to wear without socks. It took a bit to figure out how to install the Gekks correctly, but so far I love them! They're comfortable to wear and now I can go without socks! ",4
4,5,Love them!,4
4,5,Very good,4
4,4,"The product itself seems to work well so far (roughly three wears) but took a long time to receive. I had contacted customer care after not getting a shipping update after a week and received a prompt response that they were waiting on stock. I appreciate their quick response to my inquiry but would have preferred an update earlier. Otherwise, I'm pretty pleased with my Gekks so far. I will probably order more but will be prepared to wait. ",4
4,4,Hard to install!... but great once you have them in!,4
4,4,"Love the socks, but had a hard time with the grippers.",4
4,5,Love them! Easy to use and just what I was looking for.,4
4,5,"Much cooler than socks , your feet don't sweat ",4
4,5,"Love it... order a size up for tennis shoes
",4
4,4,Great to wear sneakers without socks!,4
4,5,Fantastic,4
4,5,Oh my....these are awesome!!! Going to order several more!! Best thing ever,4
4,5,so comfy! ,4
4,5,Love 'Em. Comfy and they keep my shoes from getting a little stinky!,4
4,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,4
4,5,Amazing!! I work in the medical field and don't have to worry about finding socks every morning!,4
4,4,Idea is good. ,4
4,5,I'd love a pair for all my shoes!,4
4,4,Once I got them in I really liked them. It wasn't real easy to get everything attached properly for me. When I didn't get it right the first time and had to try to take them out and start over the sticky parts would stick to themselves. I put up quite a fight with one shoe. üôà  I finally won and am glad I didn't give up. ,4
4,5,I am so happy I found Gekks!  My feet REJECT socks and I've tried them all.  These are exactly as great as advertising we'd! I will buying more!,4
4,4,The Gekks themselves are great! But the adhesive does not stay in the shoe and comes off when I take the Gekks out. The velcro bonds more strongly than the adhesive does.,4
4,5,"These are great! It's an amazing feeling to have your socks stay in place.  I can't get a pair of no-show socks to stay in place no matter what I do.  It would be nice if the foot had a bit more padding to it, but I will never go back to regular socks. ",4
4,5,"Love it, easy to use, very comfortable. I recommend it. Don't miss out.",4
4,5,"I put these in my slip on ""chucks"". I still have to ""re-set"" them every time I wear the shoes, but that might be user error. I plan on buying another pair for flats.",4
4,5,These work great with Conv. Sneakers. I even have the ones with an elastic back. They hold well and you can wear the sneakers all day with no worries of stinky sneakers.,4
4,5,"Don't know why it took me so long to try these. They are so comfortable!! I'm going to buy more for myself and a couple pair for my daughter, who BTW hates wearing socks.",4
4,4,"Yes, but you're support is awful.",4
4,5,üëç love!,4
4,5,"AMAZING. So comfortable, easy to use, I will be ordering many more! ",4
4,5,These are absolutely fantastic!,4
4,5,Didn't know what to expect and actually think they're great! Very comfy and make my sneakers much more comfortable. ,4
4,5,"Used with converse and really like them.  Sometimes I have to adjust the heel part to make sure it's not rubbing right, but so far...much better than those no show socks.",4
4,5,Love these!!!! Very comfortable & work great!!,4
4,5,Love them! I wish I could get a deal on a 3 pack. I hate wearing socks. I love how thin they are. I love that I don't have to look for my socks. They really work! No more stinky feet!,4
4,5,Love these in my Converse!  I hate to wear socks and these are the best alternative!,4
4,5,Love them so I ordered several more for my flats. ,4
4,4,They work great but we're a little hard to install. They weren't as easy as what I had expected. ,4
4,4,"I love Gekks! They solve all my problems as a person who just doesn't like dealing with socks. The sneaker version is a little harder to use than the loafers. They take longer and are a little more difficult to install. I'm using them for my lowtop Converse All Stars, and because the tongues on those shoes are so flimsy, the Gekks keep pulling them down, so I have to adjust them several times a day. I'm going to try lacing the laces through the extra loop on the tongues to keep them in place. Overall I'm so happy with this genius invention and will be buying more for all my shoes!",4
4,5,great!,4
4,5,I bought for my son and husband and they love them. First pair was a little tricky to install but worth any trouble you may encounter .,4
4,5,"Love this product! Wore them all day the first time I put them in without problem, very comfortable.",4
4,5,"Love this product! Wore them all day the first time I put them in without problem, very comfortable.",4
4,5,"great invention -wish I'd thought of it first --love them
",4
4,5,Love them  so comfortable ,4
4,4,Seem to stay in place really well. Nice not to have to search for socks,4
4,4,Ok but my toes keep slipping out of them,4
4,5,Great product!! Wore with a pair of chucks. No blisters no discomfort. Will be purchasing more! ,4
4,5,Love it ,4
4,5,"This is a holy grail product for eliminating the need to wear uncomfortable ""invisible"" socks or go barefoot inside your shoes. Somebody had his/her thinking cap on when they came up with this idea. Side note: had a delivery issue and the company was very quick to remedy it. Product and customer service are both spot on.",4
4,4,"Working very well.  Stay in shoe, don't fall, and less smell",4
4,5,They were super easy to apply and stayed put all day. They were really comfortable and no blisters or rubbing!!! :),4
4,4,Super comfortable!,4
4,5,I've only had hem for a week but they seem to work great! ,4
4,5,Just right for little feet !,4
4,5,Great!,4
4,4,"I love the product--they work exactly as described, but HATE how long it took to ship.  They didn't arrive until more than two weeks after I placed the order and the customer service never responded to my multiple requests for updates.  Disappointing.",4
4,5,LOVE!!!!,4
4,5,These are AWESOME!!!!  Love to go sockless but the aftermath is never pretty!  These give me that option!!,4
4,5,"They're great!  They stay in the shoe, feel comfy and it's like wearing socks but...without socks!  I love them!",4
4,5,"I'm really excited about using these! It feels like I'm wearing socks, and made my Converse sneakers so much more comfortable!",4
4,5,I absolutely LOVE them!!!!,4
4,5,Great!,4
4,5,I love that I can wear my tennis shoes without having to search for socks that don't show?,4
4,5,"Not the easiest to ""install"" but once they're in - they're amazing!",4
4,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these in my Converse! They are perfect!",4
4,5,"These things are MAGICAL. I didn't have to take off my shoe to readjust the liner like I usually do with socks. Super easy to install, and to slip your foot in and out. My life is forever changed.",4
4,5,I'm super excited to have installed my gekks in my new Stan Smiths. The went in easy and are comfortable. Just what I was looking for! ,4
4,5,"Love these more than I thought possible. No more sweaty feet, no more 'low cut' socks that are not nearly low enough. Invisible and effective. ",4
4,5,They are great ,4
4,4,"These certainly have made my fashion sneakers more comfortable without socks. However, I find that the heel piece tends to roll down when putting the shoes on, which can be quite uncomfortable. ",4
4,5,These work great! Easy to put in and comfortable to wear. No more worrying about finding socks that don't show. ,4
4,4,"Very cool, but kind of hard to put in smaller shoes!",4
4,5,Worked really great in my Chucks!,4
4,4,So far they are awesome!  No smell; have been using them regularly without washing them yet.  Attaching the grippers in the shoe and getting the placement right was a bit nerve wracking but it is all well in the end and I am highly enjoying them.  They even seem to keep my feet warm in the fall weather! ,4
4,5,"They are awesome! Much better than I expected. They are thin, but not cheap. I also liked that once I got them in the shoes they didn't move around. I will definitely be getting some more. ",4
4,5,Highly recommended,4
4,5,"Having a narrow heel, these help keep my Sperry slip-ons on!",4
4,4,Love being able to slip on my converse and not worry about socks showing or stinking up my shoes! Somewhat difficult and frustrating to install but worth it so far!,4
4,4,"I hate wearing socks. I also hate seeing socks with sneakers. These were easy to put in my shoes, they're very comfortable, and I'm able to be active in them. Great purchase.",4
4,5,I never have to wrestle with those terrible no-show socks again!,4
4,5,So far these have worked really well in my converse all stars. They're super comfy and they have eliminated the stink I used to get from constantly going sockless!,4
4,5,"So happy with my Gekks! Finally a comfortable, stink-free alternative to the tiny socks that inevitably slide down and bunch up under your arch. Fast shipping, great customer service and SUCH a good product!",4
4,5,I like it,4
4,5,"Purchased for a new pair of Vans.

I hate the little socks that fall down as much as I hate stinky feet.

Simple to insert , comfortable, been using over two weeks and I wear these shoes to work almost everyday AND NO SMELL YET!!

Awesome product. Will definitely be buying for any shoes I want to wear sockless!",4
4,5,Love my Gekks! I can work a 12 hour shift with them in my shoes and have dry feet the whole time! They are so comfy & breathable.,4
4,5,"So far so good on this product. My wife called it """"genius!""""",4
4,5,Easy to install. Stay put. The sock lining turned a pair of sneakers that were previously unwearable without regular socks (due to rough interior seams) into incredibly comfortable shoes. Thank you for this great product!,4
4,5,I'm getting more for all my shoes!,4
4,5,"it actually works! my shoes didn't smell at the end of the day, after a 10 hour shift at work. definitely buying more",4
4,5,"I love these sock liners! I had pretty low expectations, honestly- they sounded too good to be true. Easy to """"install"""", and comfortable. They make my sneakers luxurious to wear - goodbye to ugly no-show socks.",4
4,5,LOVE! Will be purchasing more.,4
4,5,"This is my second pair of Gekks -- I have them for my flats too -- and I'm even MORE pleased with the sneakers ones. They are just as comfortable, functional, not-smelly and easy to install as my first pair, but now I can clean out my sock drawer of all my tiny socks that have littered it since summer began. I can't say enough great things.",4
4,5,Will be purchasing more for myself and my family!! Works amazing and adds comfort to your shoe that a sock can't.,4
4,5,I bought the Gekks for tennis shoes and they have lived up to my expectations. I've worn them hiking and working out and have had no odor or sweat. I will be purchasing more soon,4
4,5,"These are a perfect fit and solution for my Converse. No slipping sock, no smell, and I forgot I had them """"on"""" until the end of the day. I WILL be buying more!",4
4,5,"At first I didn't know what to expect, all I know is I was tired of having stinky feet when I wore my chucks. I know I could always wear socks, but I hate the way they look with socks! Anyway these are heaven! I watched the installation video about 3 times before I felt confident that I wouldn't mess it up. It was just my nerves, installation was a breeze!! Once your ready, it kinda feels like a thin sock hugging your toes. True test was after wearing all day shopping, I took them off and did the sniff test...something I'd never do before....and there was no stench!! I'm officially in love with Gekks!!!",4
4,5,"I hate wearing socks, but I love wearing my vintage-inspired suede Nikes. Things were getting kind of funky, then I discovered Gekks! They were fairly simple to install, and took no time at all to get used to. I'm sure I'll be buying more in the future.",4
4,5,They were perfect! Made my sneakers even more comfy! ,4
4,5,I only wish I heard of Gekks before!! Would have saved me a lot of shoes from the garbage.,4
4,5,"A little tricky to insert in loafers/slipons and sneakers, but definitely worth it! Good feel, much lighter than the very low sneaker-socks, good absorption. Will definitely buy more.",4
4,5,"I've been using Gekks in my sneakers and loafers for a few weeks now, and so far, so good! It took a minute to get them into my shoes as a first-timer, but once I got the hang of it it became second nature. I hate wearing socks in any of my shoes, so I am looking forward to putting Gekks into all of my shoes! :-)",4
4,5,I recommend Gekks to anyone who likes going sockless!,4
4,5,Keeps your feet fresh all day. I prefer using them with the stickies it comes with on my sneakers and they still work great and stay in place. Used only the bottom flat sticky. Would recommend!,4
4,5,"I have tried SO MANY other socks for that """"sockless"""" look and these actually work! Installation was easy and the sock is so comfortable. I put them in a pair of chucks and I couldn't be happier. I wish I could use them in my heels! Will be buying more and have talked my husband into purchasing. Thanks Gekks!",4
4,5,"So in love with these. Easy to install and super comfortable. After about 5 min you forget they are even there. Also, they help to keep your foot from slipping forward in the shoe and mashing (technical term) your toes.",4
3,5,great!,3
3,5,Love the product ,3
3,5,these are life changing! I wish there is a style for Mules so I can also stop getting smelly feet from them as well! ,3
3,5,They are comfortable and fit like a golve.  Took a little to get use to at first but they are now my go to for shoes. ,3
3,5,Great fit! ,3
3,5,Must have for any loafer wearer!,3
3,5,Worked great.,3
3,5,Very easy to install and they keep my feet from sweating and smelling.  ,3
3,5,There the best  !... No more socks !...,3
3,5,"I am a die hard no socks guy, but can‚Äôt take off my shoes after a month of no socks. These things are amazing! Even on shoes that already kind of smelled, these saved them. I am impressed. ",3
3,4,They feel really great and keep my feet cool but the sticky part doesn‚Äôt seem to work too well on my Sperrys. Any tips?,3
3,5,"awesome, fits great",3
3,4,"Not perfect, but better than the Sperry no show socks that always slipped off!",3
3,5,These work great. They protect my heel and stay in place while you wear them.  ,3
3,5,"Love them, works great!",3
3,5,These models are much better than the ones last year!  Great work ,3
3,4,Great product. Feet overheat a little but are less sweaty at end of day,3
3,5,They are great.,3
3,5,My wife suggested I try these for my Sorel slippers.  The fit really well into the slipper and they work great.  ,3
3,5,My boyfriend loves them!,3
3,4,Overall great but difficult to position initially,3
3,5,Love them!,3
3,5,Cool idea!!,3
3,5,"I have only had the opportunity  to wear them once in my brand new Tory Burch mini travel flat.  They do seem to take up a little bit of extra space in the toe area, but I'm hoping since the shoe is new that they will stretch a bit and be very comfortable. I am looking forward to ordering more for my other flats and  converse ",3
3,5,"great !
",3
3,5,I bought these because I've got stinky/sweaty feet and I ruin shoes within a few months. I HATE no show socks because they do not stay on my feet at all. Gekks are LIFE CHANGING! I bought two pairs and put them in my flats and I'm in love! I am going to buy these for all of my shoes because they have solved all my shoe problems!! Thank you Gekks!!!!!! ,3
3,4,"Great product, with just slight difficulty on install.",3
3,5,"I bought a pair of gekks during the early stages of the product and they were good, not great. The new version with a better method of securing the insert is far superior. Pleased with the purchase.",3
3,4,It is very interesting when I try to give a bad review that it says something went wrong with my submitting the review. Your customer service is less than desirable. ,3
3,5,An amazing product,3
3,5,"Perform as marketed‚Äîspectacularly!  Though it took me some time to install them perfectly, as I'm the type to measure ten times and install once, they were a breeze to install and the directions were crystal clear. 

I'm a believer and am now able to wear Sperry's confidently and in a manner that is gracious to my peers.

Cheers and I wish you much success!",3
3,5,"Love them & found I didn't really need the extra set, I was just afraid I would mess up the first time I tried attaching them. ",3
3,5,Works perfectly!,3
3,4,Great,3
3,5,I think they are fantastic. I love to wear loafers and boat shoes and these are the best. My newphews were visiting and bought new boat shoes so I gifted them each a pair and they love them too.,3
3,5,good stuff,3
3,5,worked out nice,3
3,4,Excited to try them. Somewhat hard to put on,3
3,5,Great!,3
3,4,"Love Gekks, but would be easier to use if the grips were removable & re-usable. Still, a great purchase!",3
3,5,Love them! ,3
3,5,"I have been wearing these for several days in my Tieks's and I couldn't be happier! They're perfect!!! No slipping or sliding around like no show socks, and best of all no smelly, sweaty feet",3
3,5,"I have been wearing these for several days in my Tieks's and I couldn't be happier! They're perfect!!! No slipping or sliding around like no show socks, and best of all no smelly, sweaty feet",3

3,5,I love them. This pair I bought for my husband to wear his sperrys without socks and to keep the stink out...and they work!,3
3,5,Bought these for my husband's shoes. He loves them! He won't stop talking about how wonderful they are! I also bought a pair for my flats and they work wonderfully! I haven't washed them yet to see how they hold up and reinstall but I love them so far!,3
3,5,They are perfect to use in shoes that before gekks used to cause blisters.,3
3,4,"These are superior to any liners or short socks I have tried.   The company appears to be working to perfect the adhesive inside the shoe.   Former designs did not work well in some Sperrys, but were OK in Cole-Hahn.   Latest design works very well with Cole-Hahn but I have not tried with Sperry.   I will be a return customer.   ",3
3,5,"Love the new attaching system.  They work great, and are very comfortable.",3
3,5,"My husband loves them, and everyone in his office wants some now.",3
3,5,Love it. Fits great!!,3
3,5,These are so awesome!  I love them and am slowly getting them in all my favorite shoes.  I even have my husband using them now.,3
3,5,"Total gamechangers for me.  I've tried every single ""no-show"" sock brand and nothing worked better for me than Gekks.  I need to buy some more pairs ASAP!",3
3,5,"They were pretty easy to install, and they are staying in place much better than the older version.  Actually wearing my topsiders with them right now!  ",3
3,5,Husband loves the loafers in his drivers and this is my 3rd pair for my slip ons!  Love them!,3
3,4,The sticky part should be able to be bought seperate it came off and couldn't stick back on. ,3
3,5,Pretty neat,3
3,4,"Overall, love them! The Loafers & Slip-On style didn't fit quite as nicely as my Flats did -- they feel a little bit lumpy and you do need a little bit of wiggle room in your loafers b/c these make the fit slightly tighter. However, they definitely help control odor effectively.",3
3,5,Great product! So glad there is finally a solution to smelly Sperry's! ,3
3,5,I bought for my son and husband and they love them. First pair was a little tricky to install but worth any trouble you may encounter .,3
3,5,Love them.  A real shoe saver.,3
3,5,Great product! I love the new velcro addition vs the old way the gekks used to fit in the shoes. It make the product that much more comfortable ,3
3,5,The addition of Velcro makes these stay in place so much better and they're just as comfortable.,3
3,5,Love them,3
3,5,Love them  have many pairs  clean easy and back in  shoes ,3
3,5,"After my package got stolen, Gekks was kind enough to send me a replacement. I love these shoe liners. So much better than those little no-show socks that always come off, especially if they don't actually make them in a large enough size. Gekks work great and I will be putting them in all of my shoes from now on!",3
3,5,"These are great, they take a few minutes to get in place but they are so worth it. My husband & son have them too ",3
3,5,"Great product
",3
3,5,Love these!!! They stay in place and are very comfortable!,3
3,5,I obviously love em bc this is my second pair. ,3
3,5,I love the Gekks so far. The shipping took almost 3 weeks which seems like too long. The product though is easy to install and works as shown.,3
3,5,Awesome!,3
3,5,"Love my Gekks! They're super easy to use and eliminate the sweaty, gross, sockless feeling!",3
3,5,"great product
",3
3,5,They work! Luv them. ,3
3,5,love them,3
3,4,"They are pretty great. My feet still get a little sweaty, but not stinky.",3
3,5,So far they seem to be working!,3
3,5,great product especially nice can be removed/replaced,3
3,4,"Fairly easy to install with vivid pictorial instructions! Really great for flats that often expose the little sockies. Since you are unable to move the product from shoe to shoe, I'll have to buy 100 more pairs!",3
3,5,Love them !,3
3,5,Super soft and easy to apply,3
3,5,great fit - thanks,3
3,5,Great!,3
3,5,"awesome, work great as described",3
3,4,"Great product.  Slowest shipping ever and no phone number to contact the company.  Emails sent to them were never responded to. Made me feel like I had purchased a ""scam"" product. ",3
3,5,"Love the feel and fit, a bit of a learning curve to get them in but after the first time, easy!",3
3,5,I never received them,3
3,4,Gekks are extremely comfortable and make it easy to forget that you are wearing socks. They stick great inside sole and do not move. I only wish they were easier to attach and detach.,3
3,5,Life changing. I don't have smelly feet but my feet would always rub and I would get terrible blisters. That is not happening!!,3
3,5,Outstanding! ,3
3,5,"I like it so far, seems to work great.  They fit perfectly in the ballet flat.",3
3,4,I am satisfied with it. The product is of good quality and is a great alternative to wearing uncomfortable socks. The only complaint is that the heel is hard to stick but it's almost unavoidable. I definitely would recommend this product.,3
3,4,Love going sockless. Easier now with Gekks,3
3,4,They have significantly reduced the odor!,3
3,5,"These things are great, easy to install, and soft. I have bought the tiny booties and they scratch your feet.",3
3,5,I have had a number of Docksiders that I needed to replace because my sweating feet ruined them. Gekks will alleviate that issue.,3
3,5,Great alternative to socks!,3
3,5,Come as advertised. Make sure when installing the gripper to heal of loafer that you firmly place and hold on to help it stay in place. Noticed that the gripper on both of my heals do not stay stuck on and need to be careful when putting my feet in the sock as to not take the gripper off each time.,3
3,5,"I bought a pair of boat shoes were honestly too painful on the top of my foot, to wear for more than 5 minutes at a time. I can honestly say my Gekks turned them into one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. Highly recommended.",3
3,5,Great product. Very easy to install. Comfortable.,3
3,5,Even my picky Dad loves them and asking more a few more pairs.,3
3,5,The perfect socks! Definitely get more pairs.,3
3,5,Amazing,3
3,5,These are very good,3
3,5,I pulled a pair of my favorite Sperry boat shoes out of hibernation thanks to Gekks! They were easy to install and work just as advertised!!!!,3
3,5,Work great! Only wish there was some padding in the heels.,3
3,5,"I wore the gekks in loafers for two days straight in 95 degree weather I'm Boston, and they did not smell at all. Amazing.",3
3,5,Beat investment I've ever made.,3
3,5,"I just put my Gekks to the test in a pair of boat shoes snd wore them for 10 hours at work. Totally comfortable, no stinky feet. Love them. I hope they survive the wash!",3
3,5,These were everything I hoped for. Great concept and great product. I need them for all my shoes.,3
3,5,they are wonderful!,3
3,5,I bought these as a gift for my husband and he loves them! He wears them in his slip-on TOMS and says they are awesome!,3
3,5,"Purchased a pair for sneakers and a pair for boat shoes. After several wears, they have stayed secure and odorless.",3
3,5,Fit great and work well. Had them for two weeks in the heat of summer and are holding up well. Also can remove them to throw in the wash. Great product.,3
3,5,"I won't lie... I was skeptical. So I put my Gekks in expecting nothing, really. My loafers, though advertised as """"cooling"""" we're a lie, and they were getting the icky foot smell pretty badly. Gekks fixed it. Absolutely magical. My loafers have a memory foam sole, and the Gekks fit right in and now they're extra comfy. Haven't put them in my ballet flats yet, but I'm totally getting a pair or two for my converse sneakers. Do buy. These will save your shoes from early demise.",3
3,5,Hard to install but well worth it,3
3,5,Bought these for my husband and he loves them! He wants more and now I want to try the ladies socks as well!,3
3,5,"I've known about Gekks for sometime now, but was skeptical about them as a product. I finally gave in and decided to give them a try in my boat shoes. I was pleasantly surprised for a couple reasons. I wear no show socks on occasion with my boat shoes and thought the Gekks being affixed inside my shoe would irritate me - quite the opposite. They are easy to slip into and are really soft and comfortable. I mostly wear my boat shoes without socks, which means that they are more prone to odor. Again, I was pleasantly surprised at how well they are in controlling/eliminating the odor! Looking forward to getting another pair for my other boat shoes!",3
3,5,"Bought these as a gift for my husband who often wears socks with his boat shoes. He was skeptical at first, but after he wore them the first time he was amazed at how much he liked them. He wants to order more!",3
3,5,No more smell!,3
3,5,very comfortable and did not develop an order after a week of continuous use.,3
3,5,Love them.,3
3,5,Love them,3
3,5,Directions make it very easy to install in a boat shoe. They do not show at all. I am a size 13 and they are a bit snug but worth it because they cut down on foot odor so well.,3
3,5,Best invention besides AC! Wish they were around years ago! I am buying pairs for everyone I know as gifts!,3
3,5,Bought several pair of the Geeks for my sons. They were a welcomed addition to their boat shoes! I also purchased a pair for my casual work flats and they fit great and work well!,3
3,5,They were better than I could have imagined. Easy to install - great quality - so very comfortable.,3
3,5,Bought two pair of Gekks for my loafers and boat shoes. These Gekks were easily installed into the shoes and work like a charm! They provided all-day comfort in shoes that I previously had discomfort walking in. Bravo!!!,3
3,5,He loves them! Awesome gift idea.,3
3,5,"Super comfy
Easy to install
Will be buying more
Huge help with odor",3
3,5,Like wearing socks but never having to worry about loosing one of them and buying a new pair.,3
3,5,Great product,3
3,5,I bought these in the past and wasn't thrilled with the stick on because it began to role on the back of the heel. I gave them a try again and the new Velcro material is so much better. The fit perfect and are super comfortable. Highly recommended.,3
3,5,These are awesome and totally worth the money! I usually clear rooms once I take my boat shoes off in the summer but not anymore! Awesome product and I'm definitely recommending them to my friends!,3
3,5,I never have to worry about finding matching socks or smelly feet again. It's fantastic! Definitely buying another pair for my next pair of boat shoes,3
3,5,"Once you get comfortable with how to put these into your shoes, it's a breeze! It does take a little time and concentration to get them set up. But my feet were comfortable and I couldn't even feel that they were there! I wore these all summer night and they saved my shoes from sweat and wearing down.",3
3,5,"I was doubtful these would stay put, but they do and it is so easy to slip in and outmof my boat shoes with the Gekks in place.",3
3,5,"These weren't terribly hard to install on my boat shoes, and they're comfy as well!",3
3,5,"These Gekks are great. I have a very active sweaty job with tons of running around and moving heavy objects. I also sweat a lot. Geeks help keep debris from coming into contact with the feet absorbing sweat along the way! I have tried every type of micro sock, the only ones that may seem like they would work end up sliding down, to the middle of the shoe. Great idea, I need to buy more for my 7 other pairs of Sperry Topsiders. Market these heavy in Rhode Island its practically our State shoe (boat shoes)",3
3,5,"I bought two pairs of Gekks, I have one in my toms and one in my loafers. I've only worn my toms since getting the Gekks. They are very comfortable and my feet were dry when I took my shoes off.

Looks like they are working!",3
3,5,Great Product,3
3,5,Probably one of the coolest products I've seen!,3
3,5,Terrific,3

Gekks for Women,4,"I‚Äôm sure it is just a matter of practice, but I couldn‚Äôt get them inserted just so. But, once I did, they were super comfortable! I can now wear my Top Siders without worrying about socks showing or my feet being rubbed raw.",Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,4,"I love my Gekks so far, the only issue is that in my Women's Sperry Authentic Original 2-eye boat shoe, the insole is cloth not leather, so the bottom of the Gekk doesnt stick. However, the tongue and heel have stayed attached well enough that it isnt a huge problem since I dont mind readjusting them evry once in a while.",Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,4,"very comfortable, just like wearing socks!",Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,4,I didn't realize that the Gekks actually stick to the shoe so it is best to choose one pair of shoes to put them in. Once they are in and adjusted they are very comfortable and work great!,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,4,pretty much as described and functional. A little too much flex in the toes area - a little more tailored would make it a 5.,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,4,Great Product!,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,4,Very comfortable but difficult to keep in in place at the heel area,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,These are great!,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,"Wasn't sure if these would really be helpful or not but I wore them in some slip on flats with no socks, was on my feet for 5 hourse and couldn't believe how much more comfortable they made my shoes! Best part is you can take them out of one pair of shoes and put them in another. Love them!",Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,"Super easy to put in your shoes, and easy to remove and wash. Came with great instructions. would definitely buy again!",Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,"I hate going without socks! But I also hate footies on peds.
These stay in place, don't slip in shoe, and don't leave the insides of you shoes looking gross!
Wish they would make a ballet flat version.",Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,I bought size 9 women's Gekks for my boat shoes and they work great so far. I have only worn them once but so far so good!,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,"I finally found footwear for my sperrys! I wasted so much on socks that did not work, I wish I had tried Gekks sooner.",Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,I bought 1 pair of Gekks and put them in my driving moccasins. I really like them. No hunting for the right sock or footies just peaking out. I gave a pair to my son and daughter to try. I plan to purchase more in the near future.,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,"I had my doubts but I was pleasantly surprised. They actually stay in place, the are super comfy, I can move them from one pair to another and they are washable.",Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,great but I really am looking forward to the ones for ballet flats. I go sockless all the time and really want something with not so long of a flap in front.,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,I LOVE this product! Gonna get more.,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,Grest,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,they were a little hard to get in place but after I did I loved wearing them!!,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,"My wife loved the ones I bought for her, and mine are also great. Way better than low profile socks, because they don't come off!",Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,"very comfortable, Easy to put into the shoes",Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,I wear a lot of slip ons and these work great!,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,This is a good product and very useful. Fits in shoes nicely and doesn't cause any problems with fit or comfort.,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,"Buying another pair and for the review, am getting 15% off.",Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,"Love my Gekks for Woman, keeps my feet fresh and smelling good!",Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,"The idea of Gekks is just genius! I have been looking for something just like this to wear with my boatshoes/Loafers in the winter. Wish I had purchased them earlier. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE My Gekks for Women!",Gekks for Women
Gekks for Women,5,So comfortable! Was skeptic about the Gekks staying in place while walking. There was no slipping what so ever. Will buy more!,Gekks for Women
Gekks for Men,4,Using for a week so far and seem to do good.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"I like them, but I would make the heel portion wider to wrap around the sides so more adhesive area is in contact with the shoe.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,good stuff,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,I've had Gekks for about a week and the sperrys I put them in are fairly new and so far there is no smell and it feels just like socks on the inside. So overall I have no issues with the product. The only issue was the fact that my order took almost 2 weeks to get to me which was frustrating.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"I ordered the wrong size and it still works great, I want to try it out with the correct size but overall fantastic product.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"I like them, but they are too expensive.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"My husband always wore socks with his boat shoes, much to my chagrin, until I bought him some Gekks!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"I have enjoyed my Gekks. They definitely accomplish their stated purpose: They are no-show and they prevent the sweaty, smelly feet problem that comes with wearing shoes with no socks. However, I find them to be a little difficult to get in and out of my shoes. I bought my Gekks thinking that I would switch them between shoes and take them in and out to wash them with some frequency. However, I find that it's a bit of a trying process to get them to fit just right in the shoe without bunching up or feeling off kilter. With that complaint aside, this is a great product that I would recommend to others.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,Love these....feet stay cool and dry. Wish someone would have thought of this sooner. Only problem l find with them is the stick still doesn't last long so I used double sided tape and I'm good to go.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,I wasn't sure how well these would work when I ordered them but they have really impressed me. They could be a tiny bit stickier but other than that they are pretty much perfect. I had several pairs of shoes I had stopped wearing because they looked terrible with socks and weren't comfortable without socks so my new Gekks made it possible to wear them again.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"Customer service was great. I was going away on a trip soon and was afraid I wouldn't receive my Gekks in time. I spoke with customer service and my order was shipped two day express just to make sure I got them before my vacation. I've had the Gekks for about 2 weeks now. They've been very good, but the left heel portion of the Gekk continually gets pushed down. Can I get more of the sticky blue adhesive to reapply to this portion of the Gekks? Otherwise, they've been great!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,I liked the product but needed to adjust the heel several times but comfortable,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,I really enjoy the comfort and convenience of the gekks but it is troublesome to take them out and reinsert them after washing. They are still worth having them.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"I love my Gekks. My only concern is that some of the gel got stuck on the shoes and now I have some ‚Äúgelless"""" spots on my Gekks.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,i don't wear the shoes I put them in daily but I do like them & expect to get more. I am not a sock person.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,Great product! Very comfortable and significantly reduced the smell. Only minor issue is the back heel doesn't stay attached. Have to keep reattaching it.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"I wear Danskos for work, about 8-16 hours a shift. These Gekks actually work quite well. I would probably order a larger size next time. I have a 9.5 and I ordered the large, I‚Äôd probably go bigger. The sock is snug, I just would like it less snug.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"It took a little trial and error to get them positioned correctly, but once attached, they are very comfortable.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"They work perfectly as advertised, but getting them to stick and stay flush isn't always easy.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,They do a great job of keeping my feet/shoes fresh and cool. The adhesive piece that attaches to the heel seems to come unstuck a lot though. Overall a great product that I would buy again,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"They work great, but need to be available in a larger size. I wear a 13 and that is pushing the limits on size for it to stay in place.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,I have been using my Gekks for about three week now and have not had any problems with them. The are performing as promised so far and I hope they will continue to work as well as the are.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"Instalation is a little tough at first, and if you don't get almost exactly right, sometimes it won't stay in place. Once you get it right they're fantastic",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"Got a new pair of Sperrys for Christmas and put Gekks in 'em right away! The fabric is a little slick, but I'm hoping that will wear off after I break them in, and the installation was a little weird since I'm a 9.5W, but I am definitely going to buy another pair! They're so comfortable that I don't even feel like I'm wearing them sometimes, and they're the perfect solution to """"Sperry stank."""" Thank you, Gekks!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"The Gekks are amazing, they feel awesome, and really help with sticky and stinky boat show feet. However, the tongue lost its stickiness and comes off sometime, I washed them and the sticky did reset yet it kept happening. I believe its because the tongue of my shoe is a rougher leather. Regardless they do their job!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"gecks are super comfortable and do exactly what they say they will. They stay in the shoe perfectly and I've had them for a week so far,and they don't stink yet!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"Feels like I'm wearing socks when they're in, but no hassle of taking them on and off or washing frequently. The adhesive gel seems to get warped in certain areas after use but still works fine.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"I think the material great, they are comfortable, and incredibly functional. I haven't tried washing them and sticking them back in yet, but anything that requires sticking to your shoe as the only way to connect is bound to shift a little here and there, but overall I would say they are great.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,Had a nice pair of boat shoes I didn't want to ruin so I tried Gekks. Love the product and the ease of use BUT the only problem I run into is the adhesive on the top of the heel comes loose when I put my foot in. I have to use my finger as a shoe horn sometimes to avoid this problem.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,Product has been great thus far!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"Gekks is an innovative product. The socks are helpful in combating sweaty feet and alleviate the need for foot powder. Getting used to installing the socks took a few attempts, but they were comfortable and cooling on my first use last night. I will definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to go sockless.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,Pretty good,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"Had these for a bit over a week and have worn them daily. They are very comfortable and do feel like I'm wearing a sock which is nice. I can't judge the smell factor with these shoes since the shoes themselves are very old and pretty gross already. I'm looking forward to putting these in brand new shoes to see how they hold up.

They also seem to stay inside the shoe pretty easily, I haven't had much of the insert come unstuck.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,"great, need 2 more pairs. Not really interchangeable.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,4,Gel adhesive could be better but solid product all around,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I was very surprised at their ability to stay in place! Most no-show socks have a tendency to slide down but I have not had a problem with the Gekks!!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Worked exactly as described. Very convenient for boat shoes and loafers, will buy more!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,whoever thought of these things have struck gold. very good feel with the fabric used for the product. I wear them inside of a leather driving loafer. they reduce heel slippage inside the shoe you're wearing. good job Gekks!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Gekks are pretty amazing! Easy to install, no smell, and super comfortable!!! Love them!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Love these - as someone who was constantly folding socks down I'm so relieved to find Gekks!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Really like the new product. Solves a number of issues from comfort to cleanliness,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I have now bought at least 6 pairs of GEKKS and use them sock less and with socks. They are great in both cases. Really comfortable.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,So far so good!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"I bought one pair just to try these out. I've only worn them twice so far but I'm a fan. Really comfortable and my feet don't seem to sweat as much. Time will tell if they really help eliminate that god-awful sperry smell but I figure even if they do, can always wash em. Probably be buying a few more pair in the near future.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Gekks are great! I put them in a pair of old Sperry Top Siders and was amazed at how much comfort they provide, along with how much they reduce the smell that usually emanates from the boat shoes. I will definitely be purchasing another pair of Gekks soon!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Great product. Works amazing!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,This is a great product. I found this on the Internet and couldn't be happier. I now can wear my boat shoes without having stinky feet. I tried canoe socks but they are not made for people with small feet and the kept slipping off. It's spring and I don't want to wear socks anymore. I love my free feet and this product. I will be buying it again.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I asked before ordering if Gekks would work in a pair of all leather sneakers. After looking at the sneaker they confirmed they would and they are great ! Installed easily and they work as advertised !,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Super awesome,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I bought these for my husband to put in his new Sperry's and he LOVES them!! He said they feel like silk on his feet and has already asked me to get more!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,The hubby loves them!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Makes life so much easier and doesn't ware on your shoes when you where them without socks. Will buy again.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"I received them this past week, and they are definitely working. Takes some time to get used to them, but I don‚Äôt have severe complaints. I wish there could be custom made sucks for wide shoes, but they still work great!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"I've tried the no show socks with my Sperrys but they don't work, even the ones with the gripper pad on the heel. My new Gekks were easy to put in, stay in place, and provide the perfect barrier. So far no stinch! I'm hooked.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,perform as promised - love them,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Great product, now i can wear my sperry all day without smelly feet.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Theses are exactly what I've been looking for,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I purchased a pair for my husband and myself. I have been using mine and I love them. I hate wearing socks but these make my feet feel dry and no order,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,These work great! My husband needed new boat shoes badly because he always wears them without socks but he didn't want to get new ones for fear of them rubbing his ankles. These liners solved the problem perfectly and are washable which minimizes the smell. Thank you!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Awesome, wish I had invented them.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Got my boyfriend gekks for Valentine's Day. Within a day, he went to buy more for his other shoes! Great product",Gekks for Men

Gekks for Men,5,"I bought Gekks for my husband because he always hates how his other """"no show"""" socks simply DO show. These are perfect. Thanks so much!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"I'll admit, I was skeptical when considering these sockless liners. I love wearing boat shoes, and seriously, how can you wear socks with them, especially when you're sportin' shorts. But I found that these are not only very comfortable (almost as comfortable as a sock), but my feat did not stink after wearing them all day...for multiple days! I will buy more!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,They are great!!! They are better than I expected.,Gekks for Men

Gekks for Men,5,"Kick foot powders and sprays to the curb! Gekk's are the perfect solution for anyone who loves the sock-less look, but hates the sock-less smell.

This modern solution to an age-old problem is must-have in everyone's wardrobe.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,These work wonders. I bought a pair for my husband who didn't think he would like them but he says they are super comfortable and he even forgets they are there sometimes. Plus there's no odor! Recommending to all our friends!,Gekks for Men

Gekks for Men,5,If you are going to spend nearly $100 for Sperrys - spend the extra $20 and get a pair of Gekks. Here's the bottom line - my son's shoes don't stink. I'm sold!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I was not quite sure after wearing Gekks in my boat shoes the first time. It was only after wearing another pair of boat shoes without Gekks that I discovered I wanted them in all of my boat shoes. They bring comfort with none of the sweating and stickiness you get when going sockless and they are invisible to others. I'm sold and will be buying them for all of my boat shoes,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Bought these for my husband who hated to wear shoes without socks. He loves them and is telling all his friends!!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"I wear lewther deck shoes to work, and they tend to stink. I bought some Gekks and they work as advertised. No more stink. Awesome",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"This is my first pair and I like them so much I plan to buy a pair for my other boat shoes and 2 more for my sneakers, ah, my walking shoes!",Gekks for Men

Gekks for Men,5,I love wearing casual slip on type footwear for most of the year and especially in the summer. Gekks has made wearing these types of shoes incredibly comfortable and convenient to slip on. Great product. Practical and simple.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"these fit fantastically around the foot, especially around the toes once installed in the shoes",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Awesome,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I was definitely skeptical after previous purchases of other products that made marketing statements that weren't true (I guess that would be false advertising). I spent the weekend wearing Gekks and was totally impressed (and surprised). They were easy to install and remove and were very comfortable. I'm now going to get them as gifts for my friends. Highly recommend!!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Gekks are awesome. I was constantly loading my leather boat shows with powder and it wasn't doing the trick. Gekks completely replace the powder and keep my feet dry and comfortable. Buying my second pair soon!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Works great and pretty easy to insert. The adhesive really works well at keeping it adhered to your shoe, as I was worried about this not lasting. I'm on week 3 now and still no odor!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Gekks are amazing!! I have them in a pair of driving mocs and they are a game-changer. Just the other day I did a lot of traveling and my feet with cool and comfortable the whole time. No need to worry about that sweaty sticky feeling anymore. Don't let the price deter you! After a few wears you will forget that you just spent $25 on socks and wish you had done it sooner.

Make sure to adhere the Gekks properly. I read a few reviews about the sticky substance becoming loose, but I have not had any such issues yet. Enjoy!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I put these in a pair of Sperry Topsider boat shoes that my wife bought me. I've worn them numerous times since and they are in my summer rotation for sure! Follow the instructions and they work as advertised. I wear a size 12 and the large Men's size works great for me.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,backs come off a little bit but overall worth it,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,perfect!,Gekks for Men

Gekks for Men,5,Highly Recommended! Great fit and feel. Will definitely buy again.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,i was skeptical at first but I wanted to try it anyway. I was worried they wouldn't stay in place but been wearing for a couple of weeks and they have stayed put and the product description was perfect. I did cut the heel part off of them though. I didn't like that part but the product is definitely a 5 star product and does what it should.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"I just ordered a 2-pack of Gekks, but accidentally ordered the wrong size! I sent an email to Gekks customer service and they got back to me within minutes. Gekks has a truly great product and they really value their customers!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I've tried to wear other so 'low cut' socks with my loffers and they just don't work. Gekks are great. I 'm asking for them for Father's day.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"I bought one pair to try them out about a month ago. I just bought 2 more pairs today. I must say that I am impressed. They stay in place, they work as intended and they even add an element of comfort.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Just returned from a trip to Jamaica and put my Geeks to the test for the first time. They were easy to install and worked exactly as advertised. No more smell and they're super comfortable. They seem to stick well to the shoe - but do require a bit more care when putting your foot in to avoid peeling them off the heel. So far they're excellent and I would recommend them to anyone.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I purchased these from a Facebook ad and was very skeptical. I am so glad I did...these things are awesome! No need for socks and feet stay dry and odor free! Can't wait until they make them for tennis shoes.,Gekks for Men

Gekks for Men,5,great product,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,i love the no sock look and have been using no show socks by vans and they just didn't work for me. My Gekks blocked odors better than any sock and foot powder I've used. I am obsessed with Gekks and am making sure all of my friends order some!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I love my Sperry's even more now!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"I've only used them twice but so far so good. They fit in pretty easily, haven't come loose and are pretty darn comfortable.",Gekks for Men

Gekks for Men,5,perfection at it's finest. No more will I have too use moleskin to prevent blisters.,Gekks for Men

Gekks for Men,5,"Definitely more convenient than having to put on socks (and more hygienic than not wearing socks). Make sure you follow instructions carefully when """"installing"""" them into your shoes, otherwise they come out easily. Overall, great product, worth the money.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Good exelent,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,these things are unreal. No more cutting socks or stuffing them into my shoes. super easy to put in and are wicked comfortable as well. Plus they keep the sweat/stink from building up in the shoes when wearing for a long period of time,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,my gekks have been great as keeping my shoes fresh and they are very stable until my dog chewed one of them up,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Although I haven't been able to wear them too many times yet due to bad weather, they have been fantastic when I have! Virtually unnoticeable on your feet once they are on and really comfortable. I will definitely be buying another pair for the next pair of leather shoes I plan on wearing barefoot.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I just order my first pair of Gekks after thinking about ordering them for a while. I was frustrated by the no show sock that I purchase every summer and was looking for a different option. I have to say I have been thoroughly impressed by Gekks they do exactly what they advertise and they are easy to install and use. I definitely will be purchasing more and my now my wife wants some! Thanks for this great product!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Work just as expected!,Gekks for Men

Gekks for Men,5,"I just bought these and tried them out for the first time and have to say, I‚Äôm more than impressed.

Gekks for Men,5,comfy,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,so far the odor absorption and comfort are great. I had a heck of a time getting them to stay put in my sperry's because of using some footpowder previously. I have no doubt they stick great when you start with a new shoe.,Gekks for Men

Gekks for Men,5,deliver comfort and wearability as advertised.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Gekks have gotten rid of the """"smelly boat shoe"""" once and for all. I've tried numerous remedies and insoles for my Cole Haan loafers, but all have fallen short of the performance that these provide. They're comfortable, non-visible, and have saved many relationships by eliminating loafer odor. And for that, we thank you.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,little pricey but definitely worth it.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"to be honest, a little skeptical at first... However, I wore them out the other night for the first time and they were really nice.",Gekks for Men

Gekks for Men,5,Recently purchased my first pair of Gekks. Game changer!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Absolutely awesome product,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"It holds in place within the shoe and there is no stink after wearing them for hours on end. As y'all are aware, boat shoes and loafers can smell awful, but with the Gekks, they haven't smelled at all. It has been wonderful to not have to worry about the stench when taking them off or trying to wear the little loafer socks. Y'all have created an amazing product.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Perfection at its finest,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,they are great! I'd completely recommend them!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Great product! Son loves them!! Highly recommend.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Prompt delivery- can't wait to try them!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Gekks are super comfortable and odor riding socks. If you aren't contemplating buying them, just do it. It's totally worth it.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I tried it for the first time and I love how it feels. It also helped fit more perfectly compared to feeling a little loose until I put these Gekks in there.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"While my purchase took longer than expected, my Gekks are just what I was looking for. I highly recommend this product!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"At first, I was skeptical. But if you properly install them, they work like a charm. Not only do they keep my shoes from smelling, they are actually comfortable! Highly recommended!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,they made my boat shoes incredibly comfortable!!! I will be buying more pairs!!,Gekks for Men

Gekks for Men,5,"I currently got Gekks and the results are amazing!! Eliminate odor and provide a sock-feeling in the shoe. My shipment was lost by USPS, but gekks happily replaced it within a couple days. Great product, and great customer service, thanks gekks team!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Just what they described, better than what I expected. They went in as they instructed and I love stepping in and out and leaving my """"socks"""" in!! Awesome! Why didn't I think of this! You guys hit a soft spot, congrats!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,My life is measurably better than the day before my Gekks arrived.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I just got mine. I use them in my Timberland moccasins. They went in ok and are comfortable. One thing I immediately notice is they prevent my bare foot from sticking to and pulling out the bottom lining of the shoe. I have yet to wash and reinsert them.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"I was a little skeptical at first; especially because I was having problems getting them in. However, once I got them in place, I was amazed at how well they work and stay in place. I'll definitely be ordering more!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Fantastic product. They're extremely comfortable and I have noticed my shoes don't smell at all . Highly recommended.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,So far they are working well.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,Great Product,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"I have been wearing my Gekks in my everyday Sperrys for about three weeks now. I'm amazed at how well they work. Living in a hot an humid area, I was definitely skeptical that anything could help cut down on smell/sweat. Baby powder and no-show socks only offered temporary solutions. Definitely be careful peeling them off of the cardboard they are shipped in. I lost a little of the gel on the packaging, despite peeling very slowly. Overall, this is a great product that absolutely works as advertised.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,so far I am very happy with my Gekks. Great product!,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Gekks are everything I hoped they would be, moisture control and comfortable",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"They are great except for slight problem with the adhesive. My son ended up super glueing them in place:)
He says they work just fine, but he probably didn't follow you instructions to the T, with the adhesive.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"Love my new Gekks. Had some trouble adhering them to my shoes at first, but now they're great. No more smelly Sperry's!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"As someone who frequently wears boat shoes, Gekks have solved every downside associated with going sockless. Worth every penny.",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,These stay well in my loafers and I really like the way they are forming to the length of your foot instead of just being the size of the shoe,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,There awesome they make it so much easier than the low profile socks.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"It took a few tries to get them installed initially, but after a few minutes and rereading the instructions they went in fine. They work great now, no more socks!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,the idea is still new but overall the socks work really well.,Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,"i was a little nervous the day I got them. They were very uncomfortable and not sticking properly. However, they settled into a comfortable position after a few hours and now they're just perfect!",Gekks for Men
Gekks for Men,5,I never realized how comfortable having the inserts would be. My boat shoes fell better and are more comfortable!,Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,Well I liked it...Although it's a good fit but the rear end slides inwards....,4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,I'd give these 5 stars if the gel was a firmer hold. The material is amazing and they help greatly reduce the rubbing of the leather on the top of the toes. The material also dries very quickly and greatly helps reduce odor.,4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"So far so good, some of the heel adhesive wears out quickly, but doesn't make the product unusable.",4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,"Who wants socks as a gift??? When they are Gekks, you'll be as happy as the people who have to smell your shoes when you take them off. Looking forward to wearing them!",4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,"My second review for my second order, I guess they work for me. I have been into the sock less look for a while and have use loafer liners, mocsocs, from many manufactures. I finally found a loafer liner the I really like and will use on non leather shoes until Gekks makes Go Sockless for other than leather shoes. To go sock less Gekks works. On the down side I have a small foot and they only have black in stock and may not be bring back any other color. They should at least stock BROWN in small.",4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,"I ordered the wrong size. contacted customer service who said to just send them back and then they shipped the right size back. very prompt responses from them. Oh, and the product is awesome. Thanks!",4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,"These are the best thing ever according to my two sons, ages 22 & 23. They swear by them and we're happy to receive them for Christmas.",4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,I tried my new Gekks yesterday for the first time and love them. They‚Äôre easy to put on and provide just enough cushion between me and my shoe.,4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,"I love Gekks, they are more than I expected from the advertisement",4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,Don't know how these will work yet; I bought them as a Christmas present for my husband. He always complains about sweating feet when he goes without socks but I love the sockless look. They look exactly as I expected.,4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,These are great for guys who hate wearing socks. They are easy to install and are comfortable when you have them in your loafers. Great idea.,4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men

4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,Really nice!,4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men

4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,Love them!,4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,I have a tendency to sweat a lot from my feet. Gekks allow me to buy nice shoes and go barefoot without fear of ruining shoes.,4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,"I bought a 4-pack of Gekks at full price. They then launched a discount deal a day after I purchased the Gekks. The customer service team refunded me the different immediately, which was greatly appreciated. They definitely know how to please customers and get me coming back to order more in the future!",4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,My husband loves them!! Thanks!,4-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,"These things are great! It took forever to get them, but now that they're here I'll never go back!",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men

2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,I love them,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,They're well worth the money and make my leather loafers much more wearable. A little tricky to get on at times but easy nonetheless.,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"I really like them, but the price could be lower. That is what will hold me back from buying more.",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,They work and are very comfortable.,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"The product does what it‚Äôs supposed to, so no complaint there. However, I thought that they could easily be moved from one pair of shoes to another (like any other insole). While it can be done, you have to be very careful not to damage them during the removal process. As a result, you‚Äôll probably want to buy an extra pair (just in case).",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"Wore these guys in my loafers about 10 times now. They work great at keeping the sweat and smell away. However, they have a tendency to become unstuck occasionally. Still, a pretty nice upgrade from those tiny socks I used to use.",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"What a great idea! I used the 1st pair for a couple of days and realized I need these in all my shoes! My ladies styles will need a slight modification-cut off the foldup heel section for slides?-but I love the way these work. They didn't really improve the smell, but I don't have a big problem anyway. I'll be ordering more!",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,sure beats feet sticking to inside of loafers,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"Easy to install in shoe, Taking time to get confomfortable with fell in shoe,",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"Too early to REALLY tell, but so far, so good... they adjust nicely, stretch nicely and feel nicely! Now I cant say much YET about durability/long shelf life... but crossing my fingers...",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"Better than most, let's see how they hold after a few weeks",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"Feel great on your feet. Glue on one shoe didn't stick very well, keep fixing.",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"They have been great. They are a little hard to put in, and the heel tends to slip down a little, but the convenience and odor prevention are amazing",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"I LOVE the concept and like the product. I am pleased. Being picky, I would like to see the adhesive stick to the boat shoe a bit better. I followed the instructions and found that the corners would occasionally peel and bunch up where I had to take the shoe off and correct the problem. I also cannot simply slip on the boat shoes as you would typically slip one on. Because of the corner bunching issue, I have to hold the heel and tongue down with my fingers as I put on the shoe to prevent bunching. This is being knit-picky for future improvement. I would definitely buy this product again.",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,I had a continuos problem with foot/shoe odor when I went sockless - Not anymore,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"I love this product. It's great. Only complaint is that they stop guarding stench and sticking to shoes even after washes after a few months. That isn't really terrible for a life of a product, but I would be willing to pay a lot more if they made some durable enough to last the life of the shoe.",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"Gekks I found to be a bit different than I initially expected based on the images. I originally thought the liner was similar to an insole that embedded itself in the shoe, however to my surprise (and some what dismay) the Gekks were quite thin, and a bit cumbersome to place in a shoe. I do like the sticky aspects of the liner and the fact that it doesn't lift out of the shoe, however, I wish that it were more of an insole with a bit more thickness in the base. the sock area around the toe is hit and miss with me. If you put it on and its completely smooth, it is pretty good. However, most times, I find the fabric bunching under my toes, and if a rock or dirt got into my shoe, its extremely cumbersome to have to take the sock completely out to clear the debris. I think the product is very good, especially compared to what is out there in the market, however, it was not quote as good of a solution as I had initially suspected. Still an overall great product.",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"Seems to work well so far. I bought 2 pairs and one for loafers and one for my sperrys. Had a little trouble getting them to stick to the sperrys but seems to be holding now. Biggest downfall I had was shipping, it took 2 weeks for delivery.",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"nice & comfortable, doesnt come off or slide down...",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,When wearing loafers for casual occasions these are brilliant. However if you are wearing them in a business causal setting you'll have to remove them which is kind of a pain. If you are still under the impression wearing socks is NF then you should probably buy these.,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,It is about time someone came up with this idea. I wear shorts and boat shoes every day during the summer and inner soles get ruined by season's end. Gekks have taken care of that problem. I have 4 pairs. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is that the gel came off the heel and stuck to the shoe in 1 of the pairs. Otherwise great!!,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,They work well. My husband has a slight issue with them sticking to the heel of the shoe. They slip down sometimes. Other than that they are great.,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"i love these. They're comfortable and practical. The only problem is that the adhesive has wore down only after a couple of weeks, so it tends to shift around a bit. Overall and awesome product and well worth the buy!",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"these seem to work. Can't really tell so far as I haven't worn the shoes that much. They seemed a little narrow and I'm not sure they will stop sweat on the edges of the insole. Also was a tad difficult to tell if they were installed perfectly, and the multiple efforts seems to have lessened the effectiveness of the sticky part. But, they're super comfortable and seem to have worked so far. Shipping was good",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"I thought they were nice innovative product and I like that they are made in the USA. I think if you do a lot of walking, especially outside which makes your feet heat up, then you may have issues with these staying in place. That made me give them 4 stars. I walked one weekend quite a bit in NYC and they came loose towards the end of the day. Otherwise great product!",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,They work well in my deck shoes. Looking forward to trying them in my casual shoes.,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men

2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"Feel good and work well so far but part of me thinks they're not going to stay sticky. If they do and I am still happy at the end of the summer, I will make sure to change this to 5.",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,Gekks are a ton better than putting on loafer socks every day. The customer service was great and the quality seems to be good so far.,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men

2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"Gekks are a life changing product for anybody who goes sock less. It really does cut down on that rotten stench that those who go sock less know oh so well.. Make sure you use them on a brand new pair of sockless shoes and make sure you install them correctly. They are somewhat difficult to install and they do not work very well, yet they still do the job, with used/worn shoes. They stay in place for the most part. With correct installation on a new shoe, this product is the bomb .",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,4,"But like all things they could be improved. For some reason they don't stick to the back of my leather loafers very well, and I've repositioned them so many times I am worried that I've already ruined them. They work great for my sperrys but once again they don't stick very well to the back. I understand this is a new product , which just needs a little improvement. So saying all of that, you guys still get the thumbs up from me.",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men

So the gel does stick to most surfaces, but not all!",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men

2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,The three pair of Gekks that I had received last year when Gekks was getting funded through Kickstarter are holding up well. I purchased a new pair of Sperry Top Siders and placed a pair of Gekks liner in them. The process was simple. The liner did not feel like it took up any space in the shoe. I've never wore socks in the past with Sperry's. I've tried the no-show socks once and did not like them at all. The Gekks liners do keep the skin drier pulling the sweat away from skin. It was recommend that should look into wearing (start wearing) at least a light sock even with boat shoes earlier last year during a physical medical exam. I was told that it's a matter of better hygiene for the feet. I have noticed that my feet look and feel cleaner wearing Gekks.,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men

2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,"I was reluctant at first because I did not get the whole concept but they seem to be exactly as described. Only a couple things to know: 1) They feel like you are wearing socks. That might be exactly what you want, but I do not like feeling like I am wearing socks. 2) I had to take out my soles in order to put the gekks in.

2-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,the design and comfort of these inserts is truly diabolical. They take up no room and still function perfectly.

I'm going to want a couple more pairs of these, so I happily agreed to do this survey for a future discount.",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Women
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Women,4,they are a great idea! My only issue is once they are put in the shoe they are sometimes hard to get to stay in position when I put my shoe on. When it works they are great and feel great!,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Women

2-Pair Pack Gekks for Women,5,I had just purchased a pair of deerskin moccasins and knew after the first wearing (wintertime indoors) that some kind of thin sock would be necessary to alleviate that ever-so-slightly-sticky feeling I was experiencing with bare feet. I was having trouble envisioning exactly how the Gekks would work -- but they were simplicity itself to apply to the inside of the moccasins and work great! I will use them during the summer for the moccasins for perspiration and sheepskin insoles in the winter for warmth. Perfect!,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Women
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Women,5,"Love Love Love , they really work",2-Pair Pack Gekks for Women
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Women,5,I have thought there needed to be something that helped in the wearing of my loafers and boat shoes. I think I found the answer. I do love how they feel in my shoes and it helps with odor once I take the shoes off,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Women

2-Pair Pack Gekks for Women,5,they work exactly as advertised and were easy to install.,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Women
2-Pair Pack Gekks for Women,5,I installed a pair of Gekks in my Sperry Topsiders last week and was amazed as soon I put my foot in the shoe! I was skeptical that the adhesion wouldn't hold and I would be yanking them out as soon I walked because they would slip in the shoe. But a week later and no issues! And I don't have to kick my shoes off under my desk anymore when my feet get hot and sweaty without socks. These are great and I am recommending them to all of my friends!,2-Pair Pack Gekks for Women

3-Pair Pack Gekks for Men,5,"I was rather skeptical about Gekks. Not the concept but how they would actually preform. Despite my concerns I was hoping they would work as advertised and ordered a 3 pack. They arrived the other day and I was immediately impressed with the build and material quality. They seem substantial without being thick or imposing, the gel was uniform and precisely applied and one can see the care taken in designing and executing them. Applying them to my kudu leather, penny loafers was a breeze as was putting on the shoes afterwards. Sliding my foot in gave me the feeling I was wearing socks but the design kept the Gekks fully hidden and they remained so for the day. This is a fantastic product and I wish them much success. I will be purchasing more of these for the summer.",3-Pair Pack Gekks for Men
