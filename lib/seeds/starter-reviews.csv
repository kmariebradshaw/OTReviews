"I ordered this tote as an alternative to a MZW branded bag, unsure how I‚Äôd feel about it. I‚Äôve used it every day for over a month now and I loooove it. It‚Äôs so lightweight, and holds so much (sometimes too much!). The champagne color is perfect and I get tons of complements on it. I‚Äôll probably order another one in the winter - these may replace every other handbag in my closet!",OMG *** best handbag purchase in years,5,2,Ellen,,ecramer@me.com

I ordered this bag before before ordering another larger one for when my 2 kids occasionally practice with me and need to have 3 rackets. I thought maybe I‚Äôd return this bag and save the $ and use this other cheaper bag when it‚Äôs just me going to the court...this bag is so cute and well made and not bulky (like my 3 racket bag) that o immediately knew I‚Äôd keep it!

"I have this bag in blue Camo and I absolutely love it! I have a few of the Oliver Thomas sticker patches on it and they look so great on my bag! I used a blow drier to help them stick and they are staying on great! This bag is easy to wash in the washing machine and can hold over a weeks worth of clothes. I have taken it to Colorado, Northern Michigan, Nevada, and other places. I have had my bag for about a year and a half and it has held up great! I 100% recommend this bag. It also makes a great gift.",Great,5,12,Jane,G,indyclimbs@icloud.com
I have this bag in blue Camo. It looks super cool! I have some of the Oliver Thomas sticker patches on it which are amazing! I used a blow drier to help them stick better and they haven't peeled at all. I have had my bag for over a year and a half and it's held up great! I travel a lot and I have taken this bag on a lot of trips. Whenever I get home I machine wash my bag and it washes up great! This bag can hold enough clothes for me for over a week. I love how this bag has lots of different pockets to stash a bunch of stuff. There is a big pocket in the bottom that can hold a couple pairs of shoes. There is also an extra shoulder strap that makes the bag easier to carry. The name 12 really suits this bag well. You really can fit everything including the kitchen sink in it! Do yourself a favor and buy this bag! It also makes a great gift!,Great,5,12,Jane,G,indyclimbs@gmail.com

"I love my kitchen sink! I got it for Christmas and everything fits! It even has a secret pocket! It is light and the colors are fantastic (smoke and black). My only issue with it, is that there are no grips on the shoulder straps or crossbody. If I ha e my coat or a sweater one, the bag often slips off my shoulder. Any chance that you guys will make some? Then the bag would be flawless! Haven't had a need to wash it, but love that I can!",So light and spacious,4,6,Celin,W,celinwittman@gmail.com

"I‚Äôve had this bag for a couple months now and wanted to wait until I put it to use to give an honest review. I LOVE THIS BAG! I‚Äôm a flight attendant and needed a ROOMY tote that has it ALL! This is it! Lots of interior space, pockets, card holders, zippered pouches, attached key ring with lanyard, and pretty much everything you can think of! Made of durable nylon and the quality and craftsmanship gives me the confidence that this tote will last me a long time. Love how it can be carried THREE different ways: shoulder, cross body or back pack. This tote covers all the bases! Thumbs up from a frequent traveler.",VERY functional,5,23,Melody,F,mgfritz68@gmail.com
"This bag does not measure as stated on the description (or it would have gotten 5 stars). It's much smaller than it looks in pictures. Just received mine and it's barely 9x9x1, if I completely flatten it out. No way a pair of flats fit in this! But it's very cute, so I'll keep. But sure wish they made it in a bigger size. Not sure it's as functional as description says - so just be aware.",Tiny but awesome,4,24,tharvey,,harvey3942@outlook.com

First- I love the size and color of this bag. The rose gold is beautiful and the light blue liner with furry friends on it is fun. The bag is light weight and the padded strap is really soft on my shoulder - which is a treat after carrying my heavy work tote all day. BUT... a couple problems: 1) the outer quilted rose gold ‚Äúcover‚Äù on the handle ripped at the seam where the handle attaches to the bag when I put my full water bottle in the bottle/ball pocket the VERY FIRST TIME - so disappointing!!!; and 2) it‚Äôs a good size bag and with no hard bottom (like a thick cardboard insert or something) everything gets jumbled together and it‚Äôs hard to keep the bag organized or easily find stuff.,Great bag... not perfect.,3,7,Caroline,C,cpc.77@hotmail.com
As you can see I've bought THREE 12s- I love it and sent it to my daughters. I don't think it's UNFAIR that you charge for shipping for quite an expensive item. I think you need to rethink that.,shipping charges,5,12,ellen,l,ellenlatt@aol.com

"I ordered the white with black stripe, and I had expected the white to be more of a matte solid color. Instead, it's pearlescent, which I don't think really goes well with the sporty styling. Also, the strap is not long enough to use as a crossbody. The strap loop placement on each side is midway down the purse, if that makes sense, which causes the purse to flip upside down when using the shoulder strap. Really wanted to like it and did like that it had three compartments, but I'll be returning it.",not what I hoped,3,22,JOSEPHTI,C,jospackages@gmail.com

Love this bag! I get so many compliments asking where I bought it. I have the Gunmetal. I can fit 3 racquets easily. It has a ton of room and I have loaded it up with absolutely everything you need for a tournament (and more). Adore the red pockets and especially the waterproof section. Comes with accessory bags as well. Zippers are hefty and move smoothly. Adjustable padded straps help with carrying a full bag. I have checked it in baggage once and had no tears or damage. I use this daily and it has held up incredibly well. Worth the price!,Compliments galore!,5,31,T,B,tanyabrennan@me.com

"I just purchased this 24 in metallic silver at a local Runner's Edge store in FL. I really like the feel & color & design of this purse. I think I will get a lot of use out of it. It's nice and soft, so I know it'll stretch to fit my items when I end up adding more than I start my day. I'm just not sure if the magnetic closure on the one side will affect my credit card? It says RFID blocking technology pocket--is that the zippered outside pocket? so skimmers cannot access my credit card? I've gotta' look this up.... Removable strap is clever too.",Practical AND pretty crossbody,5,24,Lisalisa,,lisaelliottflcookie@gmail.com
